First, I was hoping you could help us better understand the change in Fibre Channel buying patterns that were mentioned in the release. This is actually the first Q4 I can remember the Fibre Channel business actually being down sequentially. So given the change, can you help us understand what gives you confidence business will bounce back in Q1?",Jason Nolet,"VP of Switching, Routing and Analytics","Yes, this is Jason. Let me talk about why we're confident going into Q1 and all of FY '15. I think we've talked about the strength in the solid-state arrays as a particular driver of continued selection of Fibre Channel and deployment of Fibre channel. That continues to grow. Popularity, you're seeing new emerging vendors coming out, I think nimble storage just shipped their SC enterprise. So we continue to see strong customer demand for SSC arrays and we continue to see strong customer demand for Fibre Channel associated with those arrays. The other thing I'd point out is we shipped two new products in the quarter; the first was the Product Extension Switch, the extension switch that Dan mentioned. This is a new generation business continuity device for data replication and synchronization between datacenters. We feel very confident in the position of that product in the market. And then the other is a new port blade for the 8510, this is a new 64 port blade that has about 33% increase in port density while lowering power consumption by about 70%. So, new products were very comfortable, are going to help us drive that continued Fibre Channel SAN revenue in FY '15.",1,1,1,"{'Vijay Bhagavath': 'Deutsche Bank', 'Kim Watkins': 'Citi', 'Matt Robison': 'Wunderlich Securities', 'Kent Schofield': 'Goldman Sachs', 'Chad Bennett': 'Craig - Hallum', 'Aaron Rakers': 'Stifel', 'Scott Schmitz': 'Morgan Stanley', 'Jung Pak': 'BMO Capital Markets', 'Rod Hall': 'JPMorgan', 'Jess Lubert': 'Wells Fargo', 'Erik Suppiger': 'JMP Securities', 'Mark Sue': 'RBC Capital Markets'}","{'Jeff Lindholm': 'SVP, Worldwide Sales', 'Dan Fairfax': 'CFO', 'Michael Iburg': 'Senior Director, IR', 'Ken Cheng': 'CTO and VP of Corporate Development', 'Jason Nolet': 'VP of Switching, Routing and Analytics', 'Lloyd Carney': 'CEO'}",data/outer/1242-1894/1759_num_9.txt

It looks like it changed a little bit here.",Dan Fairfax,CFO,"Jess, this is Dan. Let me make just a couple of comments. Our Q4 guidance was largely directed at the visibility we had in the funnel. And so, we touched a lot of those transactions. As we looked at Q4, we could see some dislocations continuing in particular with one of our large OEMs in terms of their business. So we factored that into our Q4 guidance. That's also of course we continue to look at that situation to monitor that as we go forward, as well as specific product refreshes at the OEMs. So we've been really pleased of course. And our HTS business has performed with their new arrays, but we're also in the middle of array refresh with EMC that will be very important to us. So we took all those factors into account when we set our guidance that the sequential growth that we're projecting now is pretty normal; a typical sequential growth we'd expect in the business.

Can you help us understand some of the puts and takes there, given that business tends to have a higher margin?",Dan Fairfax,CFO,"Sure. So again, you hit the nail on the head; the most important dynamic for us in terms of gross margin is the mix between SAN and our IT business. But as we look at Q4, we didn't talk in our prepared remarks about strength of the routing business particularly on the fact we launched two identity blades that were very attractive to the market. There was a lot of demand for those products. The bladed carried a higher margin than our blended average margin. We're looking at a chassis blade mix. And so, we're factoring in that we filled much of that demand that was pent up in the fourth quarter, and we blended that through. The other dynamic is what I mentioned just a minute ago, as we opened the call, we were very focused on customer experience in our business, and we've been happy with our support business as matured, but we'd like to put some additional investments there as we prepare for really this focus on the new IP in a much more complex domain, which we're operating in the future.

And then maybe this is another one for you, Jason. The VDX was pretty strong year-over-year, but if I calculated it correctly, it was actually -- it looked like it was about flat quarter over quarter. Can you talk about that business and how it's shaping up, and what the pipeline looks like there? Then, very specifically, one of the things you talked about, both in our conference, and also at the analyst day, was the opportunity in IP storage. Can you parse out what you see there and how those opportunities are materializing?",Jason Nolet,"VP of Switching, Routing and Analytics","Yes, you bet. So we had a great VDX quarter, I actually have the number at 5% up quarter-over-quarter, that's 63% up year-over-year, which is more than three times market growth rate by the way according to LRO [ph]. But we had records in a number of different categories, record number of fixed switch and shift, record number of modular switch and shift. We also had what we think is even a better balance than in previous quarters with respect to new and returning customers. We now see about a 50-50 balance there, which is great because we're seeing customer loyalty and customers come back and scale up their fabric environments. And from a use case and pipeline point of view, we highlighted for you in the material, one way with Yahoo Japan, which was a very large big data deployment, which you might expect Yahoo Japan has these large deployments of analytics. And we're seeing more and more customer interest in using Ethernet Fabric and VDX technology as the basis for those deployments. So that means yield times is going up, it means there is more opportunity to sell larger VDX platforms, including 8770 chassis. And then to your last point around IP storage, we're starting to see a very strong interest in dedicating IP storage networks for these emerging workflows that are growing in mission criticality. And so we're aggressively positioned at VDX. In that use case we think we have a great advantage in terms of VDX as an underweight for that deployment in terms of automation of initial configuration deployments. Large buffers were needed, and a number of other fabric properties that played very nicely to an IP storage deployment. So I'd expect you to hear more and more about our success in that space throughout the year.",2,2,1,"{'Vijay Bhagavath': 'Deutsche Bank', 'Kim Watkins': 'Citi', 'Matt Robison': 'Wunderlich Securities', 'Kent Schofield': 'Goldman Sachs', 'Chad Bennett': 'Craig - Hallum', 'Aaron Rakers': 'Stifel', 'Scott Schmitz': 'Morgan Stanley', 'Jung Pak': 'BMO Capital Markets', 'Rod Hall': 'JPMorgan', 'Jess Lubert': 'Wells Fargo', 'Erik Suppiger': 'JMP Securities', 'Mark Sue': 'RBC Capital Markets'}","{'Jeff Lindholm': 'SVP, Worldwide Sales', 'Dan Fairfax': 'CFO', 'Michael Iburg': 'Senior Director, IR', 'Ken Cheng': 'CTO and VP of Corporate Development', 'Jason Nolet': 'VP of Switching, Routing and Analytics', 'Lloyd Carney': 'CEO'}",data/outer/1242-1894/1759_num_9.txt

So, on the SSD, that's largely port growth for us, although there is a propensity for customers to enable Gen 5 technology against SSDs rather than previous technology lower port space for obvious reasons.

Can you give us a sense, it's great that you stuck to the timing. But, of the Tier 1 service providers that you are still in proof of concept with, have we narrowed down the use case that they are going to use the product for? I think I think it touched on it a little bit at the analyst day a little while ago. How close are we to making the decision into physical deployments there?",Jeff Lindholm,"SVP, Worldwide Sales","Chad, this is Jeff Lindholm. Yes. I think the use cases are crystallizing here. I tend to put the service provider you take into two buckets, one of the cloud service providers that really deploy it as a multi-tenant infrastructure inside the datacenter and we've had a lot of history already monetizing that business with a variety of Tier 1 co-providers. The bigger merging one is really the classic carrier environments where they want to virtualize their service edge and eliminate all the proprietary expenses; hardware with all this operational complexity and consulting. So we see a number of places in the conventional edge of a career network, the PE routers, the customer edge and virtual CPE is the areas where we're probably getting the most common attention happening from those service providers. And we're actually starting to see a lot of interest developing out within large scale enterprises, also looking to virtualize the edge of their networks as well. So I think the next big way is really virtualizing the infrastructure edge for both the service provider, but also on the enterprise too.",4,2,1,"{'Vijay Bhagavath': 'Deutsche Bank', 'Kim Watkins': 'Citi', 'Matt Robison': 'Wunderlich Securities', 'Kent Schofield': 'Goldman Sachs', 'Chad Bennett': 'Craig - Hallum', 'Aaron Rakers': 'Stifel', 'Scott Schmitz': 'Morgan Stanley', 'Jung Pak': 'BMO Capital Markets', 'Rod Hall': 'JPMorgan', 'Jess Lubert': 'Wells Fargo', 'Erik Suppiger': 'JMP Securities', 'Mark Sue': 'RBC Capital Markets'}","{'Jeff Lindholm': 'SVP, Worldwide Sales', 'Dan Fairfax': 'CFO', 'Michael Iburg': 'Senior Director, IR', 'Ken Cheng': 'CTO and VP of Corporate Development', 'Jason Nolet': 'VP of Switching, Routing and Analytics', 'Lloyd Carney': 'CEO'}",data/outer/1242-1894/1759_num_9.txt

Then, I also wondered if, Lloyd, you might be able to comment on the competitive environment. Are you seeing Cisco more? Anybody else out there more?

Thanks.",Dan Fairfax,CFO,"I'll start with the fed, going backwards. Today we are better positioned in the space we were at our prime, we had our best quarter in the history of the company three, four years ago when the timeframe was -- because then we were leveraged hard against one Department of Defense, one agency in Department of Defense. Right now we're leveraged against all the DoD agencies, plus the filling agency. So we have done a really good job with building the team and having a go-to-market strategy that broadens our influence and we're engaged in lot of opportunities now that are our ongoing opportunities that we'll see revenue coming over the year front. So I expect to see the fed continue to strengthen and if there is a balance there and we expect to see how literally impact on us because the breadth of our engagement now our cost -- the federal agencies. On the SAN Fibre Channel space, we mentioned competitive issue there. We were gaining market share. The sales team, the market organization has put together really good. Programs that are going to educate customers and identify capability compared to our competitors. We clearly have the better products, and we're gaining market share. We're seeing emerging markets in China, in Brazil. We're seeing opportunities emerge on the SAN side that we hadn't seen before. So we feel very strong with our ability to compete, we're the best part. We're the best go-to-market, best marketing strategy. We continue to gain market share, and we are confident at that.

Thanks for taking the questions. On the SAN switching side, or even more broadly, the relationship that you have with EMC. Can you talk a little bit about whether you view EMC's decision to buy the stake of the VCE from Cisco as an opportunity for you to deepen your relationship with EMC? Just maybe, talk a little bit in that same discussion about your -- what you view as your relative share opportunity within EMC on the SAN switching side?",Lloyd Carney,CEO,"So we have a strong relationship with EMC. And when EMC had a stronger relation with Cisco, we saw a strong one with EMC; the VCE acquisition, we actually an opportunity. And as long we are, EMC has clearly made a decision that they want to go their own way on some e-converged platform. On their non-VC integration opportunities, we work closely with them. We have a fact right now that we have certified with the EMC that include the VDX product and include their storage. They are familiar with our portfolio, they know how we can help them win, and they converge the architecture, and so we have a really strong go-to-market team that Jeff has assigned to the EMC relationship. And we expect to be leverage -- now, as of note, the EMC team goes now telling that converge that. So, we'll see how that progress over next year. So we feel pretty good about it and we feel again that the VC opportunities one that is one that will give us more.

Just a follow-up on Aaron's question; I think at the analyst day you talked about the SAN business growing slightly below the midpoint of your guidance range for FY '15. I'm assuming a lot of that is the function of being in later stages of Gen 5. Is there any comparison you can draw to the prior cycles as to what's the slowdown or what's the pause in spend ahead of a new product cycle?",Dan Fairfax,CFO,"Thanks. This is Dan. Let me -- one other thought to answer the question. There's an interest in this cycle and each cycle is not exactly that kind of an analog for the others I told that once an analog for the future. We're saying the profit -- the margins on our profits, profitability of the Gen 5 platform to be higher than we saw in the previous transitions. And we really attribute that directly to the value proposition of that platform. And so, again we feel very good about the current products in the market. As we make comments, they are extremely competitive and there is plenty of reasons for customers to refresh as we look into this next year.

Dan, your gross margin guidance looks conservative with the SAN revenue mix increasing in Q1 and VDX continues to do well. What's driving the sequential decline in gross margins at the midpoint?",Dan Fairfax,CFO," So really a couple of things to think about there -- we look at the mix of product family. So, SAN and IPC are spot on in terms of as simple as that, our gross margin should expand, quarter-over-quarter. But underneath that, our forecast is looking at the mix of products, including support into our analysis; though I did make some comments as we opened the call around investing in support infrastructure which will suppress some of the gross margin from the support team as we really work at the level of customer experience and what we deliver as a company, that's very important to us. And then the other major dynamic is there are a number of items that I won't go into and drag the call down, but the major dynamic is really in the routing family, those two high density blades. If we look at the average mix of a router, you will see compared with 40% or 50% full in terms of the blades. We ship a lot of blades into chassis that were in the market and they carry a higher margin and as a result Q4 benefited from that and we are not planning on that continuing in Q1.

Thanks.",Ken Cheng,CTO and VP of Corporate Development," Yes, this is Ken Cheng. I think we are going to compete very well, because virtual router architecture is built from the ground up or Intel, x86 architecture. So fundamentally we build a router on a scale out architecture as opposed to other vendors which basically take the 86 based architecture and just migrate that, the entire software load onto a Intel processor. So fundamentally we are going to enjoy a significant advantage because of the architecture. So what we have seen also is that, as Jeff said as the service providers begin to deploy Edge solutions and architecting about their datacenter as well as their new Edge, so-called New Edge, our footprint and architecture is going to have a significant advantage versus competitors.",10,1,1,"{'Vijay Bhagavath': 'Deutsche Bank', 'Kim Watkins': 'Citi', 'Matt Robison': 'Wunderlich Securities', 'Kent Schofield': 'Goldman Sachs', 'Chad Bennett': 'Craig - Hallum', 'Aaron Rakers': 'Stifel', 'Scott Schmitz': 'Morgan Stanley', 'Jung Pak': 'BMO Capital Markets', 'Rod Hall': 'JPMorgan', 'Jess Lubert': 'Wells Fargo', 'Erik Suppiger': 'JMP Securities', 'Mark Sue': 'RBC Capital Markets'}","{'Jeff Lindholm': 'SVP, Worldwide Sales', 'Dan Fairfax': 'CFO', 'Michael Iburg': 'Senior Director, IR', 'Ken Cheng': 'CTO and VP of Corporate Development', 'Jason Nolet': 'VP of Switching, Routing and Analytics', 'Lloyd Carney': 'CEO'}",data/outer/1242-1894/1759_num_9.txt

Is it very different from the developed market guys and then just anything else you think would be helpful for us to understand that opportunity.",Lloyd Carney,CEO,"One of the things that we are seeing in emerging markets is that they are building out significant infrastructure. If you think about India, China putting place a social security system for billion people and what the infrastructure will be necessarily do that. And what they are also doing is they are crossing or going to U.S. You look at what the major banks in China is doing and the major banks in India or Brazil, they are looking at the architecture that we've built here in the U.S., and they are just copying those and so major banks here are still buying SAN architecture, SAN storage growth is up by 37% year-over-year and so there is just nothing really shocking. They are just copying what we have done. They are building out brand new infrastructure. They are going to straight to Gen 5 because it's a brand new infrastructure. So we absolutely are benefiting from what is proven in the developed world is just being copied in the emerging markets. We are also -- were underrepresented in the emerging markets. Jeff, when he came on board, we have hired new talents to focus on the Asia-Pac market, Australia, New Zealand, they are places where we as a company with our entire portfolio of the SAN, but SAN IP, we did not have the market share we should have, based on our portfolio we have.  So we are also -- because of improved marketing, sales, the same products now are getting better traction than before. So we are seeing pretty healthy growth and the last point, emerging market is they tend to be technologies. You talk to someone in an IT shop in India or China or Brazil; they could just as well have a PhD in a technical discipline and contrast that with what you see elsewhere in the world. So they make technical decisions, they actually put their hands on the product, they test the product, they make sure it works the way it's supposed to work and we don't lose very often when we get in a head-to-head technical break off with someone, because we have superior products. And so if our sales and marketing organization gets in front of the right people, get those hands-on kind of test going we win our fair share.

So we think it's pretty early actually in that adoption and so we're pretty excited about the opportunity going forward and somebody asked earlier about EMC and that's a use case and a vision that EMC shares with us as well. So we are happy to be partnering with them on driving the technology solutions against that demand for dedicated IP-storage networking.",12,2,1,"{'Vijay Bhagavath': 'Deutsche Bank', 'Kim Watkins': 'Citi', 'Matt Robison': 'Wunderlich Securities', 'Kent Schofield': 'Goldman Sachs', 'Chad Bennett': 'Craig - Hallum', 'Aaron Rakers': 'Stifel', 'Scott Schmitz': 'Morgan Stanley', 'Jung Pak': 'BMO Capital Markets', 'Rod Hall': 'JPMorgan', 'Jess Lubert': 'Wells Fargo', 'Erik Suppiger': 'JMP Securities', 'Mark Sue': 'RBC Capital Markets'}","{'Jeff Lindholm': 'SVP, Worldwide Sales', 'Dan Fairfax': 'CFO', 'Michael Iburg': 'Senior Director, IR', 'Ken Cheng': 'CTO and VP of Corporate Development', 'Jason Nolet': 'VP of Switching, Routing and Analytics', 'Lloyd Carney': 'CEO'}",data/outer/1242-1894/1759_num_9.txt

Thanks for squeezing me in for one more. Just had a follow-up question on the Ethernet business, because it seems like VDX had a pretty good quarter, but your Ethernet switch revenue was down sequentially. I guess I was hoping you could help us understand what you are seeing in Ethernet campus, sounds like that business may have been a bit weak. What are you seeing there from a spending perspective? How are you thinking about that going forward? Thanks.",Lloyd Carney,CEO,"Yes, so this quarter we did see a little bit of weakness in the campus switching portfolio and typically would expect that to have a quarter-over-quarter uptick based on our federal business. The good news there is that the federal business this quarter had a larger proportion of that business based on datacenter switching. So the VDX product family in particular, and it's part of the reason why we saw so much shrink in VDX. That said we have a great product pipeline on ICX side, a number of new switches that we've just introduced, a distributed chassis technology that we think is going to be very differentiating relative to the legacy vendors in this space. And then, we recently announced the extension of our partnership with Aruba to include our Brocade network subscription offering. So, now we can go to our customer hand in hand and have one offer inclusive of both our large switching technology and Aruba's wireless technology under that subscription model, so really optimistic going forward on the campus.",13,1,1,"{'Vijay Bhagavath': 'Deutsche Bank', 'Kim Watkins': 'Citi', 'Matt Robison': 'Wunderlich Securities', 'Kent Schofield': 'Goldman Sachs', 'Chad Bennett': 'Craig - Hallum', 'Aaron Rakers': 'Stifel', 'Scott Schmitz': 'Morgan Stanley', 'Jung Pak': 'BMO Capital Markets', 'Rod Hall': 'JPMorgan', 'Jess Lubert': 'Wells Fargo', 'Erik Suppiger': 'JMP Securities', 'Mark Sue': 'RBC Capital Markets'}","{'Jeff Lindholm': 'SVP, Worldwide Sales', 'Dan Fairfax': 'CFO', 'Michael Iburg': 'Senior Director, IR', 'Ken Cheng': 'CTO and VP of Corporate Development', 'Jason Nolet': 'VP of Switching, Routing and Analytics', 'Lloyd Carney': 'CEO'}",data/outer/1242-1894/1759_num_9.txt

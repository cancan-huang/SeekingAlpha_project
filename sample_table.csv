So first question is on air ticketing rebate, can you let us know the rationale behind launching the program as well as how much resources future plans to allocate to this? Thank you.",Jane Sun, COO,"Sure. The reason for us to launch the air ticketing rebate is mainly due to a few reasons. First of all, externally we have seen the industry and the market has grown very rapidly, and yet Ctrip's market share is very small. So in this fast-growing market, Ctrip is very determined to extend our leadership through different strategies, including our pricing strategy, product strategy, IT strategy. So this cash rebate is one of the measures we have to take in order to rapidly grow our market share.",1.0,1.0,1.0
4622,1,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Fei Fang , Goldman Sachs,"Okay, understood. So in terms of resources, is there any guidance or visibility on how much Ctrip could potentially allocate to this?",Jane Sun, COO,"Sure. I think the guidance that we gave for the first quarter has already taken into consideration of the impact of the cash rebate for the first quarter. As we move forward into Q2 and beyond, we'll be able to give you a more detailed guidance going forward as we have more visibility. But whatever it takes for us to gain market share, we'll do it. But meanwhile, I think since we already gained quite a lot of experience last year through the coupon program for hotel, I think we will study each line very carefully to make sure every dollar we spend will generate the best return for our company and for our shareholders.",1.0,2.0,1.0
4623,2,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Fei Fang , Goldman Sachs,"Understood. Last question, can management discuss your mobile strategy for 2013, meaning how should we model the cost and benefit of your mobile investment and how do you think the competition will evolve on mobile devices? Thank you.",Min Fan, President and CEO,"Yeah. I think for Ctrip's mobile platform, last year we released mobile, a kind of mobile one-stop platform. That means we have a serious mobile app. But our main operational mobile app, we have more than 20 million downloads; that means we are a leader in this field. And I think right now the mobile OD transaction generated from the mobile apps, weâ€™re satisfied for the outcome of this mobile strategy, Ctrip platform. And I think we will continue to give high priority in the development of mobile apps as well as building the backend supporting system to ensure the seamless booking experience. And I think right now we, in the market, Ctrip mobile app is one of the hot apps used by customers in the market, and our [best] app won 2012, the award for innovative service apps in China internet industry summit. So in this year we will continue to invest more in this field and we will try to grab more and more market share.",1.0,3.0,1.0
4624,3,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Andy Yeung , Oppenheimer,"Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. My question is also a follow-up question on the air ticketing promotion. When you look at the competitive landscape over the last couple of quarters, is there anything that changed that we -- made you decide that you really need to do the coupon promotions for air ticketing?",Jane Sun, COO,"Our marketing strategy is very carefully thought of and it's evolving everyday based on the market condition. And we believe that the market is growing so rapidly that for Ctrip who has a very small market share at this moment, the cash rebate program is one of the measures we have to take to close the gap on the pricing and to extend our leadership into the market. So it's evolving process.",2.0,1.0,1.0
4625,4,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Andy Yeung , Oppenheimer,"I see. And is the rebate program directly related to the rebate coupon, can be used for air ticket or can be also used for hotel? Because when we look at your commission rate for air ticketing and for hotel, there's a significant difference between what you get in commissions for air ticket and hotel. So there seems to be less room for coupon rebate in the air ticketing program. Can you elaborate on that a little bit? Yeah.",Jane Sun, COO,"Sure, sure. I think the reason we launched the coupon is because Ctrip has a comprehensive product offering, so we can offer more choices through this coupon program. So we definitely opt for cross-selling across the borderline and we've designed the program so that every dollar we spent for the coupon program will generate the best return overall for our business portfolio.",2.0,2.0,1.0
4626,5,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Andy Yeung , Oppenheimer,"Okay, got it. And if I can, just one housekeeping question. There's a significant increase in the other income line, can you give us some idea if that's government related subsidies?",Jenny Wu, Deputy CFO,"Sure. Below the operating income, there's two major factors to increase net income. One is the other income, which is primarily the government subsidy, and in 4Q we received quite a lot, but usually the timing and the amount that we can get will depend on the government decision which is beyond our control. And the second part is the non-controlling interest. And recall, we made a lot of investments in recent years, some of them they are still at loss-making stage. And in 4Q we, probably you heard from news, we completed the second financing for one of our subsidiaries, and as a result, we will share -- we will attribute part of this loss to minority stakeholders. And that's why it impacted our net income.",2.0,3.0,1.0
4627,6,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Richard Ji , Morgan Stanley,"Hi, Min, James, Jane and Jenny. Good morning and congrats on the strong -- morning, hi. Congrats on the strong top line growth. I have two -- yeah. I have two questions. First of all, given you have been several quarters into the coupon promotion program for the hotel booking business and we are obviously seeing very strong recovery or rebound in the hotel booking volume, can you comment on the margin trend in the hotel booking business? Are we seeing margin stabilization for the time being?",Jane Sun, COO,"Thanks, Richard. Yes, we do see stabilization in margin trend. So for hotel, I think we also monitor the market development very carefully to make sure our pricing stays strong compared to all the other players in the market.",3.0,1.0,1.0
4628,7,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Richard Ji , Morgan Stanley,"Okay, yeah. Thanks. And secondly, your package tour business has been one of the bright spots of -- for your growth. And should we be worried about, you know, your all-out price war into the package tour business? And also, can you give us a little more color on the split between domestic package tour versus overseas portion? Yeah.",Jane Sun, COO,"Sure. The sales for package tour is not going to be materially impact our business because relative to the other business line, package tour still is very small and there are very few players in the market who offer similar products with Ctrip. So the impact is not material. Secondly, domestic versus overseas, in terms of volume it's about 60% overseas. In terms of revenue, it can crawl -- become about 60% to 70% of the total package tour. So overseas definitely grows very fast.",3.0,2.0,1.0
4629,8,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Jiong Shao , Macquarie Securities,"Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I have two as well. The first question is on your guidance. In the past you have given out the segments guidance in terms of the revenues. I was hoping you can do the same for Q1. And also, could you talk about your guidance for the operating margin? I think Jane mentioned stabilization for the operating margins for Q1; I was wondering, do you have a specific range? That's my first question. Thank you.",Jenny Wu, Deputy CFO,"Okay, sure. For the hotel, for 1Q, the volume may grow 25% to 35%. The price, the ADR for hotels may decline 5% year on year, which is mainly due to our further penetration into lower-star hotels and lower-tier cities. For the commission, nominal commission rate, will -- largely flattish. And the e-coupon impact will be around 10% to 15%. So revenue will grow about 10% to 15%. For air ticketing, volume growth will be 15% to 20%. Both the price and the commission rate will largely flattish. The revenue will grow 15% to 20%. For package tours, total revenues may grow 25% to 30%. And for the corporate travel, its growth will be largely in line with air ticketing business which is 15% to 20%. So for Ctrip totally, our top line will grow about 15% to 20%. For the operating margin, as Jane just mentioned, we'll see e-coupon on hotel business stabilize in 4Q. And for 1Q, we expect the similar situation. But 1Q is usually a weaker season, and so we usually see the slight margin decline Q-on-Q. So we will try our best to make sure 1Q's margin will be largely similar to 4Q which is 20% to 21%. That's the visibility we have so far. And I understand the people always want us to give the full year guidance, but actually when we look at the market and look at the competition situation, it's quite dynamic, and our visibility for the rest of the year is limited. So we believe it will be at the investors' best interest if we can guide the more realistic level when we've got clear pictures later on. So going forward we may guide on the [confident] basis. And for Ctrip, people usually know, we are very decisive to invest for our future. On the other hand, we also have very tight cost control, we are very disciplined. We will make sure we'll continue to do that to avoid any -- to avoid losing any pennies. So we will try our best. Thank you.",4.0,1.0,1.0
4630,9,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Jiong Shao , Macquarie Securities,"Okay, great. Thank you, that's extremely helpful. Thank you. And my second question is on the competition side. I think earlier Min mentioned that one of your OTA competitor launched air ticketing coupons a couple of quarters ago, now you are on the offense also. Could you talk about the current competitive dynamic between you and your OTA competitor? And also talk about the e-commerce guys, the vertical search guys and the e-commerce platform, where you think the greatest threat to you may be. Thank you.",Min Fan, President and CEO,"Yeah. I think the competition landscape right now is there's no very big difference from last quarter. And for Ctrip, I think Ctrip is still positioned, very unique positioning in the market. I'd just say Ctrip is the only OTA that has one-stop full service for -- no matter business travelers or leisure travelers. If you compare other OTAs, probably they will just do a product line which we enjoy, and for example, eLong where the main focus is on the hotel side. So I think if you compare OTAs, Ctrip has the most comprehensive product offerings, most sophisticated operating system, and advanced IT infrastructure to service our customers. And also we have our content website and also we have our full suite of mobile apps. So I think for Ctrip, we are really a kind of one-stop solution for any leisure or business travelers, they want to find a one-stop solution, Ctrip is the best place for them to use. And if you're talking about vertical search engine, I should say vertical search engine, normally they will -- just like a platform to just exhibit various kinds of medium to small travel companies and they list their products there. The service experience is not the same and other sales probably not so guaranteed, the quality is not so guaranteed. So I think for customers, if Ctrip can provide the best price as well as other search engines or other OTAs, definitely Ctrip is the best place to shop around.",4.0,2.0,1.0
4631,10,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Mike Olson , Piper Jaffray,"Hey, good morning. I think you said that mobile was 10% of hotel bookings in the quarter. And as China online travel continues to take share from offline, how important is mobile to furthering that transition and how much do you expect mobile will be of hotel bookings for the entire year for 2013?",Min Fan, President and CEO,"Yeah. I think last year we already see our mobile booking volume accounts for more than 10% of our total hotel transaction volume. So for this year I'm sure there will be still very fast and strong growth in this field. Since we have a strong team for mobile app design and interface and also I should say Ctrip wireless app is one of the first travel mobile apps to support LBS services and voice recognition. Our team continuous upgrades the platform and enrich the content to provide very good quality service based on our customer, mobile customers' feedback and booking habits. So definitely we are very confident that Ctrip still will be a far ahead leader in this field in the market.",5.0,1.0,1.0
4632,11,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Mike Olson , Piper Jaffray,"Okay. And then I wanted to ask you about travel metasearch. Travel metasearch is a fast-growing category in the US and Europe, and can you just talk about how you expect travel metasearch to grow or not grow in China and why you think that? And how would growth of travel metasearch sites impact Ctrip?",Jane Sun, COO,"Sure. I think every company has its strengths. Travel metasearch definitely has its convenience for the users, but we believe that in order for a customer to have full services, price searching is one part of the required services. After the search of the price, somebody needs to do a good job to do the fulfillment cycle. And that cycle is very well handled by Ctrip. And if you look at the US market which represents the future for China market as well, travel metasearch, Kayak does a very good job in price searching. But compared to Expedia and also Booking, their sizing and the service they can provide relatively is smaller. And recently I think they also teamed up with Booking. So everyone has its strengths and everyone provides the value to the consumers, but we believe OTA model still is the most comprehensive model for the users. And if you look at the more developed countries, that has been proven to be the model so far.",5.0,2.0,1.0
4633,12,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Ming Zhao , 86 Research,"Thank you. So a follow-up question on the margin. You're talking about flat margin from Q4 to Q1. However, you're going to report a lower top line Q-on-Q. You're also going to apply air ticketing coupon. So, how can you maintain a flattish operating margin? Is it because you're cutting hotel coupon rate further or are you cutting marketing expense? Thank you.",Jane Sun, COO,"For Q1, our margin guidance reflects the impact of the coupon program, and we will do it in a couple of ways. First of all, I think through the coupon program, on the revenue per ticket perspective, it will have a decrease. But we will work very hard to make sure the volume will partially offset that impact. Secondly, internally we will also work very hard to make sure our operation is as effective as possible. So I think for Q1 the guidance has reflected everything we can see so far.",6.0,1.0,1.0
4634,13,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Alex Yao , Deutsche Bank,"Hi. Good morning everyone and thank you very much for taking my question. My first question is on the investment side. In the previous calls, you guys mentioned that investment in 2012 would cause about 4 percentage point margin impact. How would you review the achievements so far from this investment and how do you guide to think about investments in 2013, and what could be the financial impact? Thank you.",Jane Sun, COO,"Investment in the product line and also in technology is ongoing effort. So we will maintain certain level of the investment. In 2012 we have invested in many new products and each line of business has been delivering the results meeting our expectation. So we are very positive in their growth. In 2013, we will still maintain certain level of the investment, and that has been taking into consideration of the guidance Jenny has given to everyone.",7.0,1.0,1.0
4635,14,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Alex Yao , Deutsche Bank,"Got it, thank you. Second question is a follow-up on the air ticket cash rebate. Based on our estimate, your air ticket volume is more than 15 times bigger than the second largest OTA in China. Given such a big difference, from which part, from which channel would you expect it to gain volume from by offering these coupons? Thank you.",Jane Sun, COO,"Yeah. I think air ticketing coupon is one of the strategies we adopt. We believe in order to extend our leadership, every branch needs to stay strong, including our product comprehensiveness, including our IT technology team, including our product and pricing. The coupon give us a leap on the pricing, but we also need to make sure our product is the most comprehensive, which we -- Ctrip does have the advantage in the market because we're the only platform which offers tickets, hotel, package tour, corporate travel and many other services. So if we have a comprehensive solution coupled with the air ticketing coupon, we believe our competitive advantage will be extended.",7.0,2.0,1.0

Thank you.",Jenny Wu, Deputy CFO,"The leisure travel and online travel is growing at a very robust pace and we would consider continue to see this fast growth in 2013, and we also see the continued offline to online migration. So that's one part, and we will see the core market size will continue to expand. And secondly for Ctrip, our market share in the market is still relatively small. We would expect to at least we can proactively embrace the market opportunity and to gain more market share from all fronts.",7.0,2.0,2.0
4637,16,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Aaron Kessler , Raymond James,"Yes, thank you. A couple of questions. First, just to clarify on the air revenue growth, I believe you said 15% to 20%, but then I believe you also said volume growth of roughly 15% to 20%. Can you just clarify? It doesnâ€™t sound like there's impact from the coupon in the guidance for Q1, unless I missed something.",Jenny Wu, Deputy CFO,"Sure. For air ticketing for 1Q, both volume and revenue growth will be around 15% to 20%. And you're right, the air ticketing coupon impact in 1Q will be limited. And as Jane just mentioned, we were methodically to design the whole marketing campaign and to fine-tune our tactics and the coverage and the magnitude according to the market conditions. And for 1Q the impact will be limited. For the rest of the year it will -- we will adjust, fine-tune based on the market situation.",8.0,1.0,1.0
4638,17,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Aaron Kessler , Raymond James,"Okay. And then I have just a follow-up question in terms of the air coupons also. I mean the hotel commission rates are much greater than the air commission rates for you, and so there's probably more of an incentive for consumer to opt for the lower-priced hotels, where they probably wouldn't save much on the air coupon. So just maybe if you can talk about, I mean, is a rebate on the air coupon of just a few dollars, is that enough to really gain further market share on the air whereas hotel may be more compelling?",Jane Sun, COO,"Again I think just having a cash coupon is not enough to compete in the market. Ctrip's competitive advantage has to be in service, pricing, product, IT and branding. All these five items are very important for us. So, coupon is one of the measures that will be taken by us to leap forward in the market.",8.0,2.0,1.0
4639,18,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Aaron Kessler , Raymond James,"Great. And just a final question, can you talk a little bit about the wholesale pricing environment? We were hearing I guess some of the hotels, it sounds like, pulled out of companies that were offering [post-sale] prices on other websites.",Jane Sun, COO,"Yeah. First of all, wholesale price only represents a very small portion of the total volume in the market. So that's very limited. Secondly, if the price is listed online and if it is legal and supported by the hotels, Ctrip as the largest OTA should be able to get it for our customers. And thirdly, if the price is not supported by the hotel or it is not legal, then hotel will discipline all the players in the market to create a very healthy ecosystem. And Ctrip is very much in supportive of hotels' initiatives.",8.0,3.0,1.0
4640,19,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Alicia Yap , Barclays Capital,"Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is actually a follow-up on the air. I know that you said probably 1Q will be more limited. But just wanted to get a sense like, you know, what will be your tactic? For example, are you going to follow your competitor like from route to route matching dollar to dollar like the one that you did on the hotel coupon side? And then for -- the other thing is that will airline, what is the airline views on the OTA doing the discounting? Would that be impacting their direct sales? And how will airline react on that? That's my first question.",Jane Sun, COO,"Sure. For ticket, I think we will study each line very carefully. Some of the routes probably are selling well, it doesnâ€™t take too much effort to sell. Some of the routes might take some effort to promote. And we'll work with the airlines to make sure the sales and marketing campaign we put into these markets will help airlines as well as help our customers to best utilize all the capability in the airline routes. So we'll make sure we work with all the planners to develop our strategy.",9.0,1.0,1.0
4641,20,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Alicia Yap , Barclays Capital,"So, does that mean that airline is actually supporting on you guys doing air couponing?",Jane Sun, COO,We will of course work with all our business partners when we develop our marketing strategy.,9.0,2.0,1.0
4642,21,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Alicia Yap , Barclays Capital,"Okay. And then when you say 1Q is more limited, so does that mean from time to time these things are [accelerating], you probably will increase your magnitude of the discount? Does that mean probably throughout the rest of the year we may see further margin decline if that is the case?",Jane Sun, COO,"So, first of all, our priority is very clear, market grows fast, Ctrip's market share is very small. So in this fast-growing market, our priority is extend our leadership into the market. Secondly, when we do the detailed execution, we'll be very prudent to make sure everything we design will create the best value for our company and for our shareholders.",9.0,3.0,1.0
4643,22,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Alicia Yap , Barclays Capital,"I see. And then my second question, very quickly, is on recently there were some comments that you laid off some sales ground employees. So, what exactly happened there? Is that true? And if that's so, are you actually moving more sales and marketing campaigns through online channel with the shift of the online booking that is happening? And is there any plan for you to actually cut down your call center employee as well?",Min Fan, President and CEO,"Okay. I think the expect in the past years were always -- we always study our sales channel, study the efficiency of different kind of sales channel, including marketing channels. Reducing sales presence in some airports is our consistent effort to optimize the return on investment of sales marketing. As we continue to evaluate the efficiency of these marketing channels, we will allocate our resources to more effective ones. So that's why you may know that we later in the next half of last year, we adjust some offline channels in some airports. While we're becoming more dominant in the online business travel segment, our focus right now is to penetrate more into the leisure travel market. So with that, we will allocate more resources to the channels which can generate more effective return such as online channels, such as some efficient marketing channels. So I think it's an ongoing process for us to maximum our return on investment of sales and marketing channels.",9.0,4.0,1.0

So we understand that Ctrip already being number in the business, although I agree that your market share could be a bit small.

Secondly, regarding the coupon program, I guess will customer who has coupon or gained coupon through their hotel booking, will that, I guess, will that coupon be applied to your air program or is air coupon program will be very separate from your hotel coupon program?",Jane Sun, COO,"Sure. First of all, timing, I think we're still designing and completing the program, but very much likely to be after the Chinese New Year when the market slows down. Secondly, in terms of the cross-selling, yeah, definitely I think we take into consideration of the comprehensiveness of our product.

I do understand we're probably early in the year and there are still a lot of moving parts. But just wonder, compared with your 2012, out of the major lines that have impacted your margin 2012, where we may potentially see some step-up on the cost side or where we may potentially see some leverage or saving? Just some color around that in terms of like marketing direction, that'll be very helpful.",Jane Sun, COO,"I think as we discussed, Q1 margin guidance has taken into consideration everything we can see so far.

Historically you've provided a very detailed quantitative analysis on the hotel coupon's impact on the margin side and how you will recognize those impacts. I just wonder, by the time that we have full quarter impact from the air coupon program, how will that recognition be different from the hotel coupon program and also how will the margin impact on the gross level and operating level? Thank you.",Jane Sun, COO,"So in terms of accounting, the treatment will be similar to hotel coupon. In terms of the impact, in terms of dollar amount, again as we discussed before, Q1 number is already included in our guidance. And going forward, Q2 and Q3, we need to wait until we get a bit better visibility and give you a very detailed guidance as we always do going forward.

So, who are those guys? Thank you.",Jane Sun, COO,"I think the market is so fragmented, I think Ctrip is focused on our own strategy. There are many players who can always grow. But in terms of competitive advantage, because Ctrip not only has air ticketing business, also have hotel and package tour, I think as the user getting onto Ctrip's platform, we'll enable them to do one-stop shopping plus a very high quality of the service, plus the reliability of the pricing and product.

However, I noticed last year you actually sold a majority stake of that company to [Hanqing].

For Starway Alliance, in fact it's a kind of a marketing alliance association organization and it's mainly operating within the -- along the three-star hotels, this kind of level.

So that would be very helpful for me.",Jenny Wu, Deputy CFO,"There's two parts. First one, we purchased back shares aggressively, so it decreased the share count by roughly 3 million. And on the other hand, in fourth quarter -- in late third quarter we issued a CB, and the underlying shares associated with CB is about 9.3 million. And based on the GAAP requirement, it should be treated as converted basis. So this 9.3 million shares, ADR should be left into the calculation of liability ADRs. And so this will imply about a 6% to 7% of dilution. And as of the 4Q, we have about 145 million ADR and I think we can use that like the baseline for 1Q and 2013.",13.0,1.0,1.0

The second question is still really, you know, I tried to get some clarification for air ticketing rebate program, so I really want to understand how that work. I saw a lot of, you know, rebate program attached to your flight information on your website, a lot of them. So, are you saying, even though there are a lot of attached rebate, you're not actually using it in Q1? So if you start to use it, how are you going to -- how it's going to, you know, volume and the revenue still the same growth? I really can't get that math right and I need some help on that front.",Jane Sun, COO,"Sure. As you have seen in the hotel coupon program, when we issued a coupon, volume will have a pick-up. So, volume will increase quite large, which will be partially offset by the decrease on the per hotel commission basis. So the impact on the revenue is a dynamic formula which takes into consideration the increase of the volume and decrease on the per room night income. So we are hoping when we render coupon, we set our priority to take market share. On the other hand, I think we will also carefully design the program so that the revenue gets the best return, our overall revenue portfolio.",13.0,2.0,1.0
4658,37,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Tian Hao , T.H.

So, how could you at the end the volume growth is still in line with your revenue growth in -- not hotel, in the airline front?",Jane Sun, COO,"So again we are still designing our program. Of course when the final program comes out, the end-result has taken into consideration of the revenue growth so that we don't have a negative revenue.",13.0,3.0,1.0

The share-based compensation in the future quarters will be less or unchanged in terms of the total number of -- or I'm sorry, total percentage of revenues? Thank you.",Jane Sun, COO,"Share-based compensation has two elements. One is the number of the shares we grant. The second one is valuation of the shares. The number of the shares is locked every year. So it's a steady number we can control and we control it very tightly. However, the price and also volatility of the stock will impact the valuation of the stock compensation. That number we cannot control.

So, how does it improve the total -- maintain the same level of revenue growth? Thank you.",Jane Sun, COO,"Yeah. I think we designed the program so that overall the revenue growth will be maximized.

In that case, I'm seeing that the offline booking is gradually decreasing in terms of -- as a percentage. So, isn't that affecting the -- either the top line growth as well as the margin because I think the one big advantage is the offline call center is they actually help to upsell the high margin and the high commission product versus the offline, that people can see like anything they would like to, not in the interest of Ctrip?",Jane Sun, COO,"I think if you compare the two platforms, you're right, the call center customer is more high-end, so on a per call basis, probably it generates a little bit higher revenue, which will be offset by a little bit more cost in the labor. On the online platform, on a per booking perspective, it might be a little bit lower, but again the labor involved is a little bit less.

In terms of the margin in a long term, Q4 we invest very heavily to lay out a solid foundation for the future years, but our goal in the long term should be continuously improve our internal efficiency.

First of all, congratulations on a very good quarter and also Jane and Jennyâ€™s promotion. My first question is about your margin, which came in better than expected.  I wonder if you could share with us any particular reason for that.  And also, how should we look at the margin trend for the coming quarters?  Thank you.",Jane Sun, CFO,"Sure.  First of all, I think for this year, Ctrip is very committed to invest in our product and also invested in the sales and marketing campaign, which will strengthen our branding.  Having said that, Ctrip team is always very disciplined.  To an extent we can save costs and run very efficient operation and run a very efficient [setup] in the marketing campaign, we will.  Going forward, I think for this whole year we will continuously to invest in the product line that will strengthen our comprehensiveness of the product offerings.  And also in the sales and marketing channels, we will strengthen our presence in all the channels that will reach out to our new customers. So, for Q1, our operating margins before stock comp was about 30%.  After stock comp, was about 19%.  Going forward in Q2, depending on the market condition, weâ€™re still very committed to our new product investment in sales and marketing.  So, on the top line, our guidance is about 15% to 20% year-over-year growth. The operating margin, it will be, on GAAP basis, somewhere around 15% to 17% -- I'm sorry.

The hotel booking volume actually came in softer than expected.  Any reason for slower-than-expect acceleration?  And also if you could share with us any updates about the coupon program.  For example, do you expect to further step up the discount to boost customer acquisition?  That will be very helpful.  Thank you.",Jane Sun, CFO,"Sure.  When we give our guidance in February, I think the January number came in very strong due to the Chinese New Year.  But February and March, the number was not as strong, so that was the reason.  However, from a year-over-year comparison and also from previous quarter, we believe the coupon program has been very effective. In Q4, if you remember, our hotel volume growth was about 10% year over year, and in Q1 the volume has doubled to 21% year-over-year growth.  And we will continuously monitor the market condition to match up to any coupon program thatâ€™s available in the market. Secondly, also in the market we have to be smart with which are we will invest our money in.  So when we look at the hotel market, there are regular and mainstream hotel market, and there is also [group power] market.  The mainstream hotel market is our focus because that promotes our branding and also that promotes our customersâ€™ loyalty.  For the [group power] market, that doesnâ€™t carry Ctripâ€™s brand, and therefore we do not focus too much on that area.

So, overall, revenue growth is forecasted at 15% to 20% year-over-year growth. Air ticket volume is going to be 10% to 15% year-over-year growth, and price and commission remain to be flat.  So that gives us the revenue 10% to 15% growth.  Corporate volume is 10% to 15% year-over-year growth, and price and commission remain flat.  And the revenue is going to be grow at about 10% to 15%.  So if you add these three items -- and also package tour, our forecast is about 25% to 35% year-over-year growth.

So, just piggybacking on that question regarding hotels, like your sales and marketing cost, it seems to be it was down a little bit.  Is there any correlation between sales and marketing in the hotel side, as we expect volumes to increase to the second half of the year, should we also expect sales and marketing costs to incrementally go up? And the 30% kind of margin that you talked about the in the past, can we expect to be a ceiling or is that a floor, when you look out over the next couple of quarters?  Thanks.  Iâ€™ll stop there.",Jane Sun, CFO,"Sure.  I think the sales and marketing campaign will be kept down for this year to promote our products.  In order to be very successful in the product line, I think both products need to be very strong and also sales and marketing campaign needs to be kept up.  So, on the product line, I think as [Fan Sung] discussed, we have extended our product line into all dimensions, including our small hotel hostel model, our Smart Hotel Choice, and also weâ€™re testing the water for the vacation rental market.  So I think our product is the strongest in the market. With that, that gives us a very strong base for running sales and marketing campaign.  So we are prepared to spend money into online -- both online and offline channel to strengthen our branding this time. So, 30% of operating margin before stock comp is for the full year.  That gives us a baseline.  So, somewhere around 30% is what weâ€™re shooting for.  Depending on the quarterly number and the seasonality, sometimes it will be a little higher, sometimes it will be a little bit lower.

So, could you guys like give us more color of the reasons behind it, while we know that the pricing of tickets and hotels are in general going up year on year? And then secondly, I'm also curious on Janeâ€™s comment about those like group buy or big discount hotel offerings by some of your competitors.  So, just wondering on the (inaudible) why you think consumers would not be attracted by these big discounted offerings while branding would still be important to most consumers?  Thanks.",Jane Sun, CFO,"Sure.  So, let me ask -- answer these two questions separately.  The first one is the commission rate in air ticket.  If we look at per ticket basis, dollar amount per ticket decreased about 5%.  So thatâ€™s about $2 -- RMB2 for ticket.  $1 was due to the price decrease, another RMB1 was due to the commission rate.  So, these two elements is not within our control.  From quarter to quarter sometimes it can be up, sometimes it can be down.  So itâ€™s very moderate when we look at the past quarter. The second one is on the hotel.  I think the majority of the hotel are very -- would like to get the maximum their hotel yields.  So, to an extent they can get more money for every hotel room they (inaudible) help hotels very much to maximize their revenue stream.  On the consumer side, obviously the coupon is attractive to the consumer, so, Ctrip rebated cash to the consumers to match up with the market. And then the comments on the group buy is that when the group from company sells these hotels, itâ€™s sold under the groupâ€™s name.  At the backhand, although itâ€™s provided by OTA, the backhand name is not presented to the customer.  So, your branding, your brand is not rooted in these consumersâ€™ hearts, so you donâ€™t get credit in the sales and marketing. Secondly, on the profit, you donâ€™t get any credit on that either because coupon, as you all know, is a low-margin business.  So, last year, I believe the market had thousands of different coupon company, and this year in the market, the number of the coupon company has reduced to half.  So thatâ€™s already been such big change.  Most of the coupon products probably is not sustainable.  That is why we do not want to spend too much efforts to a product that neither gives us the branding nor give us the customerâ€™s loyalty or give us the bottom line.  So thatâ€™s where the comment was coming from. James Liang Yes.  Also I will some color for your question.  I think for the hotels side, the coupon model is a kind supplementary sales channel for some hotels, but will not be the main channel or the main stream for hotel sales and marketing practice.  And also in terms of most of the international branding -- international brand hotels or those -- will establish local brand hotels, [group pang] model is just a very small supplementary sales channel for them. So I think for -- in fact, Ctrip will also have more [group pang] buying products in our website, but this mainly will come as very good supplementary for those, for example, new hotels, or for those hotels when they are their low season.  So weâ€™ll build this as just a supplementary sales channel for hotels and also can bring value to those price-sensitive customers.",3.0,1.0,1.0

My second question is try to get a better color on the second half travel demand and also Ctrip (inaudible) growth.  I guess (inaudible) information I got from other internet companies results and guidance so far is that for some cyclical internet sector such as online advertising and online recruitment, they have all seen the increasing (inaudible) in the advertising demand or recruitment demand.  But on the other hand, they are expecting the revenue to be more second half loaded, so they expect better second half outlook.  So, Ctrip as operator in also cyclical travel -- online travel segment, should we expect your year-over-year revenue growth to be higher in second half, not only I guess given the potential higher demand but also given the easier comp versus 2011?  Thank you.",Jane Sun, CFO,"Yeah, I think our team works very hard obviously to deliver as high number as possible.  But to be prudent, I think our visibility right now probably only allows us to give you the second quarter of the guidance.  But weâ€™ll work very closely with our partners to make sure when we give third quarter and fourth quarter guidance, itâ€™s as insightful as possible.

First question, regarding the gross margin trend going forward.  This quarter we have gross margin about 75.2%.  Can you give us a view over the next few quarters?  And if you can, can you please provide us the gross margins right now by segment, thatâ€™ll be great.  Thank you.  That will be my first question.",Jane Sun, CFO,"Sure.  The gross margin for Q1 is about 75%.  In Q2 itâ€™s probably around 73% to 74%, mainly due to our efforts and determination and to keep up with the (inaudible) program.  Going forward, I think in the long, long term, a 70% gross margin is very sustainable in our business.  So, thatâ€™s how we forecast our gross margin. In terms of product line breakup, hotel is the highest in terms of gross margin, 85% to 90%.  Air ticket is the lowest, 65% to 70%.  And the vacation package is in between because itâ€™s a combination of ticket plus air -- ticket plus hotel, so the gross margin is about 70% to 80%.

Can you give us a view as to, are you expecting that you will continue to invest in these two area over the coming few quarters?  Thank you.",Jane Sun, CFO,"Sure.  Sure.  For product development, yes, I think we have lined up all the new business development, including the ones we have already talked about, the vacation rental program, the hostel model, Smart Hotel Choice, our (inaudible) platform, our 3G product line.  So we will keep up with our efforts in this new investment.  So, although this year the market will take a hit, we believe in the upcoming years all these new product lines will generate very good results for us.  So the efforts will be kept up. In terms of G&A, that is the line we control very tightly.  This time you see about RMB7 million in G&A was due to a VAT tax reform.  As a result of this VAT tax reform, there is about RMB7 million to be reclassified from the business tax line to G&A.  On the net-net basis, there is diminimus impact on the bottom line.

Again, congrats to both Jane and Jenny.  I have two questions as well.  First is more like a follow-up, operating margin question.  I think, Jane, you mentioned earlier that GAAP operating margin guidance for Q2 is 17% to 18%.  I was wondering, could you give us the non-GAAP?  And I also want to make sure I heard you right that the 30% operating margin, non-GAAP operating margin, is for the full year, and that by end of the year the target is 35%?  Thatâ€™s my first question, on margins.",Jane Sun, CFO,"Thanks for your question.  First of all, I think for the full year, non-GAAP operating margin is targeted at 30%, not 35%.  Obviously weâ€™ll work very hard to deliver good margin, but so far, 30% is our guidance. Secondly, on GAAP basis, operating margin for Q2 is about 17% to 18%.

6629,11,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","May 16, 2012 9:00 p.m. EDT",Jiong Shao , Macquarie Securities,"Okay.  Thanks for the clarification.  My second question is, competition, obviously in recent years, players like Taobao and others, [Choona], have got into the market, and most recently, even Suning start to sell tickets and hotel online.  Could you just elaborate a bit just to us on the call how you think about competition going forward?  Whatâ€™s the competitive advantage Ctrip has against all these competitors?  Thank you.",Min Fan, President and CEO,"I think that recently there are emerging quite some players, try to provide travel solution to their customers.  And like you said, Taobao, even Suning [Iko] is also entering this market.  But I think (inaudible) very prominent leading (inaudible) in China, and I think the biz model of Ctrip is quite different from (inaudible) or Suning or other, even also the search engine, what they are doing.  And we are the most comprehensive travel product platform, and weâ€™ll provide our service and products through three major platforms, website, call center and mobile.  And we can deliver reliable service from online to offline.  So I think this is quite different and also this is also our competition edge over other players. I think if youâ€™re talking about the competition advantage of Ctrip, Ctrip has a full key features, what you can see, the big difference from other players.  Ctrip offers one-stop solution for our customers.  And although customers may find some products and other like, you know, other websites, either itâ€™s hotels or air ticketing or other product, but all these platforms, the after-sales service, and Ctrip is the only one-stop comprehensive travel solution platform in China right now versus other players.  So this is one big difference. And also, secondly, Ctrip has our three major platforms which is quite different from other playerâ€™s operations.  For our customers, our customer can reach Ctrip by website or by call center or by mobile device.  Those channels operate 24 times 7, and our service quality is the best among the industry, with very high standards, while other websites or other players, probably they can provide different products, but most of them, they will rely on third-party agencies to fulfill the orders, while Ctrip, we will sell our customer from the very beginning to the after-sales service. And thirdly, I think the -- for Ctrip have already very good centralized and standard processing system, and probably Ctrip is the first company applies Six Sigma quality consumer (inaudible) in travel industry.  So, people -- customers will not just try to find some products online, but they will try to get the -- try to get highest and consistent service quality with lower costs.  So this is what can provide while other players itâ€™s very hard to provide. And also I think for travel industry (inaudible) website can do everything.  You still rely very much on whether you have very experienced, skillful [management] team and service delivery team.  And this is I think Ctrip has the strongest results in travel industry.  So I think we (inaudible) all the competition in the market and also if there are more online players, in fact all these players can educate customer in more efforts, but at [last], customer will -- customer will choose the most reliable and most high-quality player in the market.",6.0,2.0,1.0

Somebody asked earlier about the easier comps in the back half of the year, but I wanted to ask about Q2.  I believe your Q2 revenue growth comp is a bit easier than last year.  So, would you say that your Q2 revenue guidance is suggesting that you're seeing more headwinds for growth in Q2 compared to Q1, or would you say itâ€™s just conservative given itâ€™s the same range of 15% to 20% on an easier comp?",Jane Sun, CFO,"Q2, obviously our team work very hard as strong results as possible, but there are a couple of things that we cannot control.  First of all, James has talked about the GDP growth rate has been revised down a little bit, so we need to take that into consideration.  There is also some obstacles in the southern part of China that make travelers a little bit concerned.  So there is always certain uncontrollable events that we need to consider, take into consideration when we give our guidance.  That is why we give number at about 15% to 20% range.

The first one, our competitiveness will reflect in the volume, because no matter if itâ€™s a strong market or a slower market, as long as we run efficient and strong execution, we should outpace the market based on the baseline.  So that number I think reflects our competitiveness. On the pricing, normally hotel and airline sets the price.  And that is going to be determined in the market condition, supply and demand to drive the pricing structure.  We can monitor it but we cannot control it. On the commission rate, again that is also determined by the hotel and by the airline.  So far it looks like very stable, so thatâ€™s the best visibility we have on these three items.",13.0,4.0,1.0

How much of the proceeds remain from 2008 and 2011 tranches today? And how much of US$300 million recently announced in the US$180 million CB remain today? Thanks.",Jenny Wu, CFO,"Thanks for the question, Jin. For the guidance, firstly, for the top-line guidance, the total growth will be around 15% to 20%. For the OP margin non-GAAP, for the first quarter we forecast it to be around 20% to 25%. You will see it will be lower than the third quarter because fourth quarter is usually lower season. So normally during the normal business year, the fourth quarterâ€™s margin will be lower than third quarter. And plus, in third quarter â€“ in fourth quarter, we will see this winter came early this year and it kind of affect our business. And also for the year-end we usually will also accrue some bonus. So, 20% to 25% is the range we will try our best to reach. And for the share buyback, you are right, under the three existing board-approved share buyback plans, the total quota is RMB415 million. And as of November 6, we already purchased back RMB294 million. So we still have aggregate together we still have around RMB120 million roughly left for the buyback.

And can you comment on the feedback so far you have received from your service partner regarding your open platform and whatâ€™s the status there? And also regarding your outbound traffic, can you comment on the total revenue contribution and how should we look at the margin trend of outbound travel service? Thank you.",Min Fan, Co-founder and CEO,"Yeah, I think Ctrip is very open to work with various partners in the travel industry, and including the traditional agency and also other hotels. Our open platform will bring in more service providers to meet customersâ€™ needs, particularly leisure travelersâ€™ increasing demand for more comprehensive and attractive products offerings. I think, in fact, Ctrip start our business with a very open model and platform. We have the right infrastructure and technology to support the open platform to service the partners with more effective and smooth solution. More importantly, I think Ctrip has most experienced team in the network and industry knowledge to be innovative and, in the same time, to really command the model and have better executions than our competitors. And we have the big travel traffic and largest base of customers, so I think for the open platform definitely will give us more value to contribute more to our partners. And the more traffic and better service, these are the fundamental values for our partners they will appreciate. And just for simple example, with Ctripâ€™s open platform our target customers can find probably old products prices when you book â€“ when you need to plan or book a business or leisure travel as well as travel tips or even the switch apps, so I think this will be â€“ weâ€™ll have seized advantage over other players. And in the market I think no â€“ thereâ€™s no other players that do this kind of one-stop solution â€“ travel service solution for customers. In terms of the international travel market, I think outbound travel is growing very fast in China along, with the increased household income, RMB appreciation and also relaxed visa restrictions. And according to BCG report, outbound travel will be growing at a CAGR of 17% between 2010 and 2020. So for Ctrip, we will provide the most comprehensive product offerings and also high service quality for outbound travel in China. We have been very actively expanding the international travel products to service the fast track travel demand. And, as we just said, we have corporate with our global leading partners and also we have very good â€“ we have also signed strategic contracts like the Accor, Hilton, International, InterContinental, Jumeirah, Marriott, Shangri-La, and those major hotel groups we established direct connection with those hotel groups. Definitely we will work more effectively both our international hotel coverage to a great extent. And also this year, weâ€™re launching our new international air ticketing channel. This booking engine by far is the best online international air ticketing booking travel in China, obviously has kind of functionality. And also for leader travel, we are best positioned in the Greater China region, and we have (inaudible) in Hong Kong, and also recently weâ€™re working very hard in the major destinations in Asia regions. We have a very good strategic growth offering partners in different major top destinations. So, by far, I think Ctrip is the very â€“ right now is in a very good position in this market.

Clearly, you will see the good momentum carried over from 3Q to 4Q. And for commission per room night, again, firstly for this listing price, we see it will trend down about 5%. Again, itâ€™s largely due to the increasing contribution from lower-tier cities and lower star hotels. And for the nominal commission rate, again, it will be flattish.

Thank you.,Jenny Wu, CFO,"In the third quarter, the pricing is largely flattish and also this commission rate it tend down about 1 percentage points, but we think itâ€™s still largely flattish. And what we said that in the first half of this year the commission not only the commission rate trends down by the 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points, and for the â€“ always see itâ€™s about like 4 percentage points trend down. And in 3Q it end up only about 1%. So, youâ€™ll see normal â€“ itâ€™s very normal to us. And so far what we say that for the commission rate we still can be about 4% to 5%. That level can be sustained, I think at least for the next several years. And just the airlines, they will adjust their compensation to us based on the timing and on the demand, so Q-on-Q, month-by-month, there were will some saturation. And even we look at the 4Q, based on our current visibility, the pricing will probably trend down about 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points and for the nominal commission rate, again, about 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points. Our judgment about last year, the similar period of last year, is kind of a high base. And also, the airlines will also adjust that based on the demand.

During your convertible call I think you mentioned that it will be an accretive EPS for the offering?",Jenny Wu, CFO,"Sure, it goes like that, firstly, you will see, as of 3Q this year, we will have about 136 million ADS outstanding. And for the CB, we issued about RMB118 million and thatâ€™s the proceeds and the conversion price is US$19.37. That implies it will be about additional 3.9 million. So, thatâ€™s according to the GAAP accounting rule. For the CB, it will be classified under the traditional converted accounting basis. And this 9.3 million will be added to the share count when we calculate the EPS. So, it will be about like 7% dilution for 4Q. And if we consider the CB and plus the combined cost spread we purchased, the earning could be accretive because, firstly, for this CB alone it will be about 7% dilution. But for the cost spread it actually consists of two call options; first call option is the stock price again matched away this stock price $19.37. And if the CB holders excise their conversion at that price, we can activate this first call option and then buyback the similar amount of shares, so that dilution is not off, itâ€™s zero. But either way, only by this call option it can be super expensive. So the normal practice of the CB market is that we will canâ€™t really buy â€“ sell additional call options, and that stock price is about 15% premium versus the CB, thatâ€™s in price â€“ stock price about $26.34. And if the stock price reached that level, we can ask JP Morgan, our brokers, to buy back about the similar amount of the shares, which is about 5% of total shares from the market, so that we can â€“ in this way we can buy back this additional 5%, so that way itâ€™s only about 2% dilution from the CB plus the cost spread.",10.0,5.0,1.0

So CB itself will have accretive to EPS. And also if you take into consideration of buying back stocks by using these proceeds, the shrinkage for the shares outstanding up until now is about 12% because we bought back about $300 million and our market share right now is about $2.5 billion, thatâ€™s about 12% outstanding shares already being brought back.

Thank you.",Jane Sun, COO,"I think that our competitive strategy â€“ I think itâ€™s a question for you to ask our competitor. For us, we just monitor the market very carefully, whatever is available in the market we just match up to it. So, so far in last quarter it was about 15% of the total hotel revenue. And going forward again itâ€™s about 10% to 15%. But we are equipped by our financial strength to run any marketing, if our competitor enlarge their offering, we will match it up, if they reduce we will reduce accordingly.

Itâ€™s just competitors â€“ we have no control of that and, therefore, as we will continue to match. From our guidance, as you know, that Yang declined in 3Q about this coupon cost about 15% decline and in fourth quarter, we guide about 10% to 15%, decline again.

Just one follow-up question on the margin front for 4Q. You guided the margin 20% to 25%. That seems to be a pretty wide range. So I just wanted to get a little bit of color on the margin guidance. Just wondered like what are the key factors that could potentially swing that margin more towards lower-end and versus high-end? Also, I think Jenny just gave the guidance â€“ the margin breakdown for 3Q. So which factor could be â€“ what were those the incremental negative impact on 4Q from R&D, labor, or the coupon level? It seems like overall coupon promotion seems to 4Q from 3Q.",Jenny Wu, CFO,"Thank you for the question. For that one, for 20% to 25% non-GAAP OP margin is still our present-day forecast, and I see I think for under the current visibility that probably close to the low-end. And itâ€™s still impacted by the effective wage to talk about. Like for this year, overall the GDP â€“ the product development will cost about 4 percentage points margin motion and 2% is from labor, and the rest of the impact will continue from the e-coupon and our sales and marketing campaigns. This kind of the trend will continue trend in 4Q and I think that will still be the major factor to affect our margins.",12.0,1.0,1.0

When you say the margin for 4Q trends toward the low-end of the 20% to 25% as incremental base 24% right there. So youâ€™re basically saying in 4Q overall your promotions or your sales and marketing effort or is it coupon overall should be pretty heated compared with 3Q, right?",Jane Sun, COO,"For that one, you know, the spending for each item will vary from quarter-to-quarter. And for fourth quarter â€“ for the other I mentioned, we will also consider, you know, in a normal year, the 4Q margin will be lower than 3Q. And then based on my estimate, it can tend to be a bit lower than about 3 percentage points Q-on-Q. And then so I think if we achieve a 25% non-GAAP operating margin in 3Q, this 22% thatâ€™s the normal run rate. And on top of that, where you have like I mentioned this tough marketing spend is still going on and then e-coupon still going on and also we have some year-end bonus accrual in here.

I have a follow-up question regarding the hotels that stopped the coupon program. I donâ€™t understand why this is good for the, for Ctrip and OTA if the hotel comes out to stop it because isnâ€™t that aggressive coupon program take the market share from the hotels and thatâ€™s why the hotels stop it, that if they stop then the growth rate will go back to the previous level and so thatâ€™s net-net at least not a positive thing? I just donâ€™t understand the math and you can help me see what do I need to understand?",Jane Sun, COO,"Sure, sure. I think the coupon program is very unique in China market. If you look at the whole world, there is very few company in the whole world offer coupon. And in order for the industry to grow in a very sustainable level, we always support a very healthy ecosystem. So hotel, OTA customers, all the partners in this ecosystem have to have a winning strategy, then the industry will grow. If somebody started to have a rational competition to dispose the market, we do not think itâ€™s a sustainable strategy. So that is why for coupon, we didnâ€™t match immediately because we wanted to make sure the ecosystem is protected. However, if somebody still keep up with this strategy, we have to match up to it. But I think weâ€™re already seeing the industry leaders have voiced their concerns. So we support the healthy ecosystem to go back and everyone have their own balanced sales channel for it. So either way, I think if the e-coupon volume will be higher, but the commission rate will be a little bit lower or if the hotels do not want you to issue coupon, volume might be a little bit lower but commission rates will be higher. So whoever can win, needs to win on service, on product, on the IT system.

And so far can you comment on the feedback from your customers regarding your coupon program and also have you seen your company gaining traction at the expense of your competitor and should we expect hotel revenue to reaccelerate and going forward?,Min Fan, President and CEO,"For our coupon program, I think we launched the last quarter and as you know Ctrip is the largest OTA in China. We are entitled the best price policy. If someone starts any additional marketing which diverts the market to compete on prices, we have to match the offerings and (inaudible) of products necessarily. I think since the launch of the coupon program last quarter, we do see the positive feedback from market and I think Ctripâ€™s coupon program works our expectations so far. It was one of our strategies to penetrate the long-term market and also as you know we encourage our clients to redeem their coupons online, so it will also encourage customers to book online. We expect the coupon program takes 2 to 3 quarters to show the effect on volume. Of course, we will monitor and evaluate the market carefully and we will see the future response.",2.0,2.0,1.0
4388,3,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","February 20, 2012 8:00 PM ET",Richard Ji , Morgan Stanley,"Thank you. Hello? The follow up question is regarding your margin trend and obviously and due to the rising labor cost and also this marketing initiative and we are seeing some margin pressure near term, when should we expect this margin to normalize? And can you also comment on your internal cost-saving measures and particularly and given that you are expanding aggressively online and can you also shed some color on the margin profile and for online transactions given it tends to be more scalable longer term? Thank you.",Jane Sun, CFO,"Sure, we believe 2012 is the year for Ctrip to make certain investment. For every dollar we spend into the marketing, into the product development, we carefully measured the investment to return. However in order to compete effectively with all the other players, we have to make further investment in sales and marketing as well as the product development areas. So for 2012, we expect our operating margin before stock compensation is about 30% for the full year. For Q1 because, itâ€™s the slower season than the other quarters, the operating margin before stock compensation is about 27% to 28%. The decrease in the margin is mainly due to two areas. The first one is about 5% is due to the people related cost across the line. The second one is the sales and marketing, specifically very much driven by the coupon program and to add to Fanâ€™s comments earlier, we do see some pickup on the volume in hotel revenue. And in the future quarters, we intend to keep up with the efforts we have made on our coupon program to make sure we further gain market share in the competitive landscape. So thatâ€™s the margin. In terms of the cost saving, again I think Ctrip internally is a very disciplined company. We use all kinds of measurement to control our cost and measure our efficiency. We use Six Sigma to measure every almost key business processes. So we will keep up with the efficiency we can control internally and save these money to further invest in our marketing efforts.",2.0,3.0,1.0

Secondly can you help us understand the margin deterioration in fourth quarter? So operating margin went down by 4 percentage points and gross margins is down 1%, product development 2%, sales 2%, and to what extent is the margin decline due to the coupon program and to what if then is due to actual investment and also the labor cost increase? Thank you.",Jane Sun, CFO,"Sure. If we compare Q3 versus Q4, margin decreased from Q3â€™s 41% to 35%, which is about 6% decrease. Included in the 6%, I think 2% is related to sales and marketing, 1.5% of this 2% is the coupon program. And the rest is mainly for the head count related costs across the line.",4.0,1.0,1.0

First question, can you give me the breakdown, the gross margin breakdown by each product segment? And then my second question, when I (inaudible) come out with the second question.",Jane Sun, CFO,"Okay. The gross margin is still within the range. For hotel business, itâ€™s about 85% to 90%. For air tickets, itâ€™s 65% to 70% and leisure travel package is in between, so 70% to 80%. And may I ask you to repeat the second question again?",5.0,1.0,1.0
4392,7,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","February 20, 2012 8:00 PM ET",Chen-Yi Lu , Cowen & Company,"Not yet. So again the question is, for this cash coupon, right, does that hit the cost of goods, or I think it hits the net revenue, right. So that impacts the gross margin, right?",Jane Sun, CFO,"Sure. If the coupon is cash rebate or if it is to redeem our existing products, then itâ€™s account to revenue, net against the net revenue. But if it is a small gift for example, lamp or a small item, a luggage, then itâ€™s classified as sales and marketing cost. So itâ€™s in both lines. The ratio is about 2:1, 2 is in the cost, 1 is in the sales and the marketing.",5.0,2.0,1.0
4393,8,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","February 20, 2012 8:00 PM ET",Chen-Yi Lu , Cowen & Company,"Okay, great. My next question regarding the hotel revenue. This year, this quarter, the hotel revenue grow about 11% year-over-year in renminbi term, this is low. So can you give us a view in terms of hotel reservation business in 2012? That would be great. Thank you.",Jane Sun, CFO,"Sure. Let me start with Q1 first for each line of business. For the full year, we probably have to wait a little bit longer. When we have better visibility, weâ€™ll give a full year top line break for you. For Q1, hotel revenue has three elements. For volume growth, itâ€™s going to be 25% to 30% which accelerates from the previous year partially due to the program. Price is flat and commission rate is about 5% down. Again, itâ€™s because of the counter revenue derived by the coupon program. So the total net revenue for hotel is going to be 20% to 25% up on the year-over-year basis. For air ticket, volume growth is expected to be 15% to 20%. Price is expected to be down 10% and the commission rate is flat. So that gives us a revenue increase of 5% to 10% increase year-over-year. And package tour is 25% to 35%, corporate travel, 5% to 10%, which if you aggregate everything, that gives us about 15% to 20% year-over-year growth Q1 revenue.",5.0,3.0,1.0

I was wondering if you can help us understand how you determine the reasonable returns for your customer acquisition costs, in particular for the hotel coupons, I think you increased the level of rebates in December from October. Have you seen a proportional acceleration in your hotel revenue growth since? And the follow up is if you can disclose how much of your sales and marketing cost growth was from advertising costs versus head count? Thank you.",Jane Sun, CFO,"Sure. Customer acquisition costs, regular customer acquisition costs remain very consistent. Couponing is on top of it. The growth rate, although we just started in Q4, we already seeing the pickup in low end hotels. That is why in Q1, the volume growth reaccelerated to about 20% to 25%. So we intend to keep up with the coupon program to match any pet campaign in the market to make sure that the pricing everyone is the same. So everyone will come back to compete on product and service. So thatâ€™s our game plan. Catherine, did you have the second question?",6.0,1.0,1.0

And then secondly, we have seen quite an increase in advances from customers in the fourth quarter sequentially. So could you also comment on that one as well? Thank you.",Jane Sun, CFO,"Sure, for the fourth quarter all the revenues are mainly driven by the volume. We see price and commission remains very consistent from previous quarter and previous year.

You talked about difficult comparisons that you experienced in 2011, but your guidance for Q1 revenue growth of 15% to 20% doesnâ€™t necessarily suggest that weâ€™ll see an acceleration versus the growth rates that we were seeing in 2011. Do you expect growth? I understand youâ€™re going to be spending more and the margins are going to be impacted but just on the revenue growth side, do you expect revenue growth later in 2012 will be higher than what your outlook for Q1 suggests?",Jane Sun, CFO,"Obviously, I think with all the marketing efforts we have put in, we will go very aggressive on the top line. However, in the first quarter of last year, I believe we still grow at a very high rate, more than 30% year-over-year. So the base for Q1 was still very high and normally for Q1 travel season is relatively lower. So hopefully with all the marketing efforts we have put in, we will give 100% efforts to generate as good a number as we can going forward.",8.0,1.0,1.0

In other words, when can we expect the top line growth to grow faster than the operating expenses?",Jane Sun, CFO,"Yes, this year I think we increased our investment in both sales and marketing and product development. So for the new product that we believe which has a potential to explode in the future, this year we increased our investment.

4401,16,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","February 20, 2012 8:00 PM ET",Wendy Huang , RBS,"Thanks. My first question is I want to get more clarification on the Q1 guidance. You mentioned that the hotel commission rate will be down 5% due to the coupon program, but my understanding is that most of the coupon costs will go to the cost of sales and also the research marketing costs. Why it is still affecting the commission rate? And also you said the corporate travel will only grow 5% to 10% year-over-year. Given that there is still great potential for the corporate travel business in China, why your growths were slowed down so dramatically?",Jane Sun, CFO,"Sure. The first question is the coupon. Coupon is recorded as counter revenue instead of cost of goods sold. So itâ€™s in the counter revenue which also impacts the gross margin and when you try to break it out, itâ€™s not volume related or price related. So it is mainly treated as a commission related item. Thatâ€™s why commission rate will show about 5% decrease. On corporate travel, corporate travel clients normally give us air ticketing business. So when we look at our forecast, whatever air ticketing business can grow is mainly going to be similar growth trend for corporate travel. Volume growth has still outpaced the market quite a lot. The market is only about 5%, below 10% but the volume growth is for Ctrip is about 15% to 20% growth. However, we saw in the first quarter due to the slower season, price is down about 10%. Thatâ€™s why if you add these two factors together, we see about 5% to 10% increase in overall revenue for air ticket and also corporate travel.",10.0,1.0,1.0

During these years, we tried to provide more and more leisure products and to acquire more leisure market share.

So start from last year we will invest to like the (inaudible) model and (inaudible) model. They are also quite similar to that hotel model abroad and also the if you view (inaudible) which is a kind of mixture, home away and B&B. So I think those products, they have very good potential in the near future.

So just if you can clarify maybe what the impact of the coupon was, because I think youâ€™d originally said itâ€™s was COGS I guess, but now itâ€™s contra revenues. So just maybe the impact of coupons on the Q4. And then also, how do hotels feel about the couponing program because you might be actually be pricing below the hotel rate and the US has gone more to pricing parity. So just curious what the hotel reaction has been to the coupon program as well, thank you.",Jane Sun, CFO,"Sure. First of all, I think for the hotel side they are not impacted at all. The price is still the same. What we do is for every bookings the customer make, they will be entitled for coupon which they can apply for the next stay and to deduct their payment.

For Q1 guidance, we guide hotel volume to accelerate to be 25% to 30% which will be offset partially by commission rate of 5%.

I think this is a supplemental product to address the needs in the market. But as we can see, group buying module is still not a mainstream product in the hotel business.

And so far can you comment on the feedback from your customers regarding your coupon program and also have you seen your company gaining traction at the expense of your competitor and should we expect hotel revenue to reaccelerate and going forward?,Min Fan, President and CEO,"For our coupon program, I think we launched the last quarter and as you know Ctrip is the largest OTA in China. We are entitled the best price policy. If someone starts any additional marketing which diverts the market to compete on prices, we have to match the offerings and (inaudible) of products necessarily. I think since the launch of the coupon program last quarter, we do see the positive feedback from market and I think Ctripâ€™s coupon program works our expectations so far. It was one of our strategies to penetrate the long-term market and also as you know we encourage our clients to redeem their coupons online, so it will also encourage customers to book online. We expect the coupon program takes 2 to 3 quarters to show the effect on volume. Of course, we will monitor and evaluate the market carefully and we will see the future response.",2.0,2.0,1.0
5990,3,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","February 20, 2012 8:00 PM ET",Richard Ji , Morgan Stanley,"Thank you. Hello? The follow up question is regarding your margin trend and obviously and due to the rising labor cost and also this marketing initiative and we are seeing some margin pressure near term, when should we expect this margin to normalize? And can you also comment on your internal cost-saving measures and particularly and given that you are expanding aggressively online and can you also shed some color on the margin profile and for online transactions given it tends to be more scalable longer term? Thank you.",Jane Sun, CFO,"Sure, we believe 2012 is the year for Ctrip to make certain investment. For every dollar we spend into the marketing, into the product development, we carefully measured the investment to return. However in order to compete effectively with all the other players, we have to make further investment in sales and marketing as well as the product development areas. So for 2012, we expect our operating margin before stock compensation is about 30% for the full year. For Q1 because, itâ€™s the slower season than the other quarters, the operating margin before stock compensation is about 27% to 28%. The decrease in the margin is mainly due to two areas. The first one is about 5% is due to the people related cost across the line. The second one is the sales and marketing, specifically very much driven by the coupon program and to add to Fanâ€™s comments earlier, we do see some pickup on the volume in hotel revenue. And in the future quarters, we intend to keep up with the efforts we have made on our coupon program to make sure we further gain market share in the competitive landscape. So thatâ€™s the margin. In terms of the cost saving, again I think Ctrip internally is a very disciplined company. We use all kinds of measurement to control our cost and measure our efficiency. We use Six Sigma to measure every almost key business processes. So we will keep up with the efficiency we can control internally and save these money to further invest in our marketing efforts.",2.0,3.0,1.0

Thank you.",Jane Sun, CFO,"Sure. If we compare Q3 versus Q4, margin decreased from Q3â€™s 41% to 35%, which is about 6% decrease. Included in the 6%, I think 2% is related to sales and marketing, 1.5% of this 2% is the coupon program. And the rest is mainly for the head count related costs across the line.",4.0,1.0,1.0

And then my second question, when I (inaudible) come out with the second question.",Jane Sun, CFO,"Okay. The gross margin is still within the range. For hotel business, itâ€™s about 85% to 90%. For air tickets, itâ€™s 65% to 70% and leisure travel package is in between, so 70% to 80%. And may I ask you to repeat the second question again?",5.0,1.0,1.0

So again the question is, for this cash coupon, right, does that hit the cost of goods, or I think it hits the net revenue, right. So that impacts the gross margin, right?",Jane Sun, CFO,"Sure. If the coupon is cash rebate or if it is to redeem our existing products, then itâ€™s account to revenue, net against the net revenue. But if it is a small gift for example, lamp or a small item, a luggage, then itâ€™s classified as sales and marketing cost. So itâ€™s in both lines. The ratio is about 2:1, 2 is in the cost, 1 is in the sales and the marketing.",5.0,2.0,1.0

This year, this quarter, the hotel revenue grow about 11% year-over-year in renminbi term, this is low. So can you give us a view in terms of hotel reservation business in 2012? That would be great. Thank you.",Jane Sun, CFO,"Sure. Let me start with Q1 first for each line of business. For the full year, we probably have to wait a little bit longer. When we have better visibility, weâ€™ll give a full year top line break for you. For Q1, hotel revenue has three elements. For volume growth, itâ€™s going to be 25% to 30% which accelerates from the previous year partially due to the program. Price is flat and commission rate is about 5% down. Again, itâ€™s because of the counter revenue derived by the coupon program. So the total net revenue for hotel is going to be 20% to 25% up on the year-over-year basis. For air ticket, volume growth is expected to be 15% to 20%. Price is expected to be down 10% and the commission rate is flat. So that gives us a revenue increase of 5% to 10% increase year-over-year. And package tour is 25% to 35%, corporate travel, 5% to 10%, which if you aggregate everything, that gives us about 15% to 20% year-over-year growth Q1 revenue.",5.0,3.0,1.0

I was wondering if you can help us understand how you determine the reasonable returns for your customer acquisition costs, in particular for the hotel coupons, I think you increased the level of rebates in December from October. Have you seen a proportional acceleration in your hotel revenue growth since? And the follow up is if you can disclose how much of your sales and marketing cost growth was from advertising costs versus head count? Thank you.",Jane Sun, CFO,"Sure. Customer acquisition costs, regular customer acquisition costs remain very consistent. Couponing is on top of it. The growth rate, although we just started in Q4, we already seeing the pickup in low end hotels. That is why in Q1, the volume growth reaccelerated to about 20% to 25%. So we intend to keep up with the coupon program to match any pet campaign in the market to make sure that the pricing everyone is the same. So everyone will come back to compete on product and service. So thatâ€™s our game plan. Catherine, did you have the second question?",6.0,1.0,1.0

You talked about difficult comparisons that you experienced in 2011, but your guidance for Q1 revenue growth of 15% to 20% doesnâ€™t necessarily suggest that weâ€™ll see an acceleration versus the growth rates that we were seeing in 2011. Do you expect growth? I understand youâ€™re going to be spending more and the margins are going to be impacted but just on the revenue growth side, do you expect revenue growth later in 2012 will be higher than what your outlook for Q1 suggests?",Jane Sun, CFO,"Obviously, I think with all the marketing efforts we have put in, we will go very aggressive on the top line. However, in the first quarter of last year, I believe we still grow at a very high rate, more than 30% year-over-year. So the base for Q1 was still very high and normally for Q1 travel season is relatively lower.

You mentioned that the hotel commission rate will be down 5% due to the coupon program, but my understanding is that most of the coupon costs will go to the cost of sales and also the research marketing costs. Why it is still affecting the commission rate? And also you said the corporate travel will only grow 5% to 10% year-over-year. Given that there is still great potential for the corporate travel business in China, why your growths were slowed down so dramatically?",Jane Sun, CFO,"Sure. The first question is the coupon. Coupon is recorded as counter revenue instead of cost of goods sold. So itâ€™s in the counter revenue which also impacts the gross margin and when you try to break it out, itâ€™s not volume related or price related. So it is mainly treated as a commission related item. Thatâ€™s why commission rate will show about 5% decrease. On corporate travel, corporate travel clients normally give us air ticketing business. So when we look at our forecast, whatever air ticketing business can grow is mainly going to be similar growth trend for corporate travel. Volume growth has still outpaced the market quite a lot. The market is only about 5%, below 10% but the volume growth is for Ctrip is about 15% to 20% growth. However, we saw in the first quarter due to the slower season, price is down about 10%. Thatâ€™s why if you add these two factors together, we see about 5% to 10% increase in overall revenue for air ticket and also corporate travel.",10.0,1.0,1.0

So just maybe the impact of coupons on the Q4.

Thank you.",Min Fan, President and CEO,"Yes, we have around hundreds and 1,000, around 1,000 hotels. So where is the group buying model website and we do see this group buy model, group buying model is quite welcome among those low-end customers as well as the very price-sensitive customers. But so for the total production is still very small compared with our total hotel production in terms of load night. But we think itâ€™s a value add channel for Ctrip to offer this product to help our customer to find more suitable products and as well as to help our hotel partners to get incremental margins. I think this is a supplemental product to address the needs in the market. But as we can see, group buying module is still not a mainstream product in the hotel business.

Can you provide us with more granularity about the impact from coupon program versus the organic commission rate -- commission rate? And also so far, what are the feedback from your hotel partners regarding your ongoing coupon program? Thank you.",Jenny Wu, Deputy CFO,"Thanks, Richard, for your questions. For the first question, hotel commission per room night, for second quarter, our commission per room night declined. It's really for several reasons. Firstly, for the hotel pricing, it's largely declined by 1% year on year. And the nominal commission rate is still very flattish. And currently we obtained about 14% to 15% commission rate from hotels, which is still very sustainable. But our various kind of promotional activities, largely this e-coupon, impact our effective tax rate. And that's mainly the key reasons. And going forward, we still foresee this, for the pricing-wise, because we are -- become more aggressive in penetrating into [lower staff] hotels and in the western areas, so this, on a blended basis, average pricing will see the downward trend. But on the other hand, for our existing hotels, especially for the four-star and five-star hotels, the room rate still have the upward trend largely due to the inflation. So, on a blended basis we will see there will be a slightly downward trend for the pricing per room. But for the nominal commission rates, our best visibility so far is still very sustainable, about 14% to 15%. And on the second question, for the hotel partners, we can pass to Jane for the answer.",1.0,2.0,1.0

4802,3,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","July 25, 2012 9:00 p.m. EDT",Richard Ji , Morgan Stanley,And also we observed an increase of your costs in the past quarter. Can you give us a little more color on your headcount target for the year? And how should we be looking at the margin trend? And when should we expect that to be stabilized? Thank you.,Jenny Wu, Deputy CFO,"Yeah. For the -- indeed we see the costs -- the total costs and expenses is climbing up on a year-on-year basis. For the full year on the headcount-wise, we are still very disciplined. We will not allow the headcount growth to exceed the top-line growth. But this year we have already communicated with the investor community that this year our margin will be on a downward trend. And previously we are talking about for the full year the OP margin will be largely around 30%, which imply about 10 percentage points drop, and 4% is related to the new business development, and 4% is due to sales and marketing, largely due to this e-coupon program, and 2% is due to this labor cost. And since late part of second quarter, we launched a more aggressive sales and marketing campaign where we're beginning to utilize those kinds of efforts in terms of product offering, sales and marketing and internal operation efficiency to continue to expand our leadership. So, as a result, we will -- we foresee to incur additional expenses mainly on sales and marketing. So for the second quarter we see probably the OP margin will be lower than second quarter. So it will be I think probably around 25% to 27%. This additional decline in margins will be largely due to the additional sales and marketing expenses, which is 50% is largely for the e-coupon and the rest half percent is for the -- the rest is for our normal advertising efforts. And for the full year, I think, for the fourth quarter, seasonality-wise, it will have a lower margin than 3Q. But for the full year, on our best judgment so far, would be it will be still around 25% to 30% range.",1.0,3.0,1.0

So I guess my first question is regarding the dividend. You talked about buying back stock on three different tranches over the last few years. Can you just talk about how -- where we are in the process in terms of the last couple of tranches that you talked about? Are we completely done with that? Are we going into the recent USD300 million realm that you just launched? Can you kind of divide that up for us in terms of where we are in the process of the dividend? And I have one more follow-up questions regarding the margin. Thanks.",Jenny Wu, Deputy CFO,"Okay, thank you. Yes, we have three share buyback programs adopted in 2008, 2011, 2012, and so far we pretty much utilized all of the [quotas] under the first two programs. And for the recently announced share buyback program, we target to buy back around USD300 million shares. And as of July 24, we already used about close to USD100 million for this new program, and we are -- we believe -- our management team believes the current stock price heavily undervalues the Ctrip value.

And just going back to margins, I may have missed it, you said your margin target for the year now is 25% to 30%? And so, if that's the kind of the new range now, what should we -- where should margins fall assuming that the top line is, in the second half of the year, isn't as strong as what we've seen in the first half of the year and given the fact that your cost structure continues to go up? Should we assume that you probably come in at the 25% if we don't see the top-line leverage that we should expect in the second half of the year?",Jenny Wu, Deputy CFO,"Firstly, for the third quarter, for the top line we guided total revenues will grow 15% to 20% year on year. And we believe our guidance is prudent and also feel that, because, firstly, you see currently, although the visibility is still limited for the second half this year, a slower economy is more likely to happen, and our business, especially business travel domestic part, it's quite [sensitive] to the macro and will be impacted. And on the other hand, of course, the [travel] industry has inherent uncertainties and risks such as weather conditions. And for us, Ctrip team always try our best. And based on our track record so far, we can continue to outperform the market. But indeed there are a lot of uncertainties. And on the other -- meanwhile, we also put a lot of efforts in building the new products and in [inaudible] users, and every effort that we put into so far, it will take sometime for them to see the full-fledged result. So we still believe there should -- inherently there's operating leverage blended in our model, but it takes sometime.

But if you break down to volume versus revenue, volume growth will be stronger. For hotel, I think the volume growth will be at 20% to 30%, which will be accelerating from the current level due to our investment in the sales and marketing. But on revenue side, the revenue will be partially offset by the e-coupon program. So that's what you see in the blended revenue growth.

That will be great. And then I have a follow-up.",Jenny Wu, Deputy CFO,"Sure. The top-line growth, as we mentioned, will be 15% to 20% year on year. And the breakdown will be on the year-on-year basis. And firstly for hotel, we forecasted revenue will grow by 10% to 15% year on year. As Jane mentioned, we'll see the very strong volume growth which will be around 20% to 30% year on year, but the commission per room night will largely -- will trend down by 10% to 15%, mainly due to our promotional activities such as e-coupon and group buying. And for airline part -- ticketing part, total revenue growth will be around 15% to 20% year on year, which is largely driven by the volume growth which is also 15% to 20%. Commission per ticket will be flattish year on year. For the package tour, revenue growth will be around 20% to 30%, and for Ctrip organic part, the growth will be around 30% to 40%.

I think the volume pretty much mainly in line with the [guidance], but the commission rate actually declined faster than the last time when company got 9%. Can you give us a view as to why the commission actually declined faster? Is it because the company offered more coupon or is it because the overall market was softening that the hotel [inaudible] the customers? And also, can you give us a view to overall hotel business as to which segment is doing better? Is economy hotel doing better or is the higher-star hotel doing better? Thank you.",Jenny Wu, Deputy CFO,"For the commission rate, I think you referred to the effective commission rate, which is commission per room night. It's comprised by three elements. First one is the price for the room night, which is largely flattish and will be flattish in the third quarter. And the second element is nominal commission which we foresee will be still flattish, as we talked at the beginning of this call. And we still see 40% to 50% commission rate will be achievable in the coming years. And for the third, the last component, is promotional impact, which is largely from the e-coupon and group buying. And it will impact our growth by 10% to 15%. And we believe this -- we noticed the intensified industry competition and also the [inaudible] from the leisure travel markets where our team is very determined to be in the competition and to gain more market share for the leisure travel products. So I think we're very committed on that, and it will impact our commission -- effective commission rates for several period of time.

I have two questions. The first one is about your M&A strategy. In the past when you guys talked about the M&A target, you guys mentioned you will be radical leaders in travel-related area but not necessarily overlapping to your core OTA business. Now, given that the competition in the online travel agent market is intensifying, would you consider leverage the capital resource to consolidate the market, which means that you buy the similar business model companies? And second question is regarding the e-coupon program, can you share with us the progress and achievement of the program? And also in using what metrics do you evaluate the effectiveness of the program? If possible at all, would you be able to share with us any relevant operating metrics, for instance, percentage of redemption rate, percentage of redemption treated as operating expense versus the [contract] revenue, et cetera? Thank you.",Jane Sun, COO,"Sure. So I will walk you through these two questions. First of all, M&A strategy, Ctrip historically has been very disciplined in terms of teaming up with another company. So we mainly have three types of goals. The first one is, if the company can extend our product line into the market, we'll be very interested in talking with them. Secondly, if a company can speed up our penetration into a market that we do not have a presence in, we will be very interested also. And thirdly is a very long-term investment that will extend our leadership in the long term. And normally the teams that we team up with are very strong in execution and share the same philosophy with Ctrip team. Only if these criteria are met, then we will make a move. So we will keep up with our disciplined philosophy in executing our M&A strategy. So that's the first thing. The second thing is, on the e-coupon, I think, first of all, we very much like to maintain a very healthy [eco] environment. However, if the competition becomes a little bit irrational, we reserve our available funds to strengthen our sales and marketing campaign. Right now, as we disclosed, we have USD800 million on the balance sheet, USD300 million is allocated for our buyback program, more than USD500 million available funds is available for our sales and marketing activities and other operational activities. Whatever will extend our leadership into the market, we will decisively do it. So, for e-coupon program, it is an example for us to extend our leadership into the market share. The [TPR] we're looking at is the volume growth into the market and market share gain. So, a comparison between us and the other players in the market is being very carefully monitored. And we will keep up with our efforts to make sure our presence into the high-end as well as low-end customers is strengthened.",4.0,1.0,1.0

And then high-level question here following on somebody else's question about top-line growth. You suggested in the past that one of the major factors negatively impacting revenue growth in recent quarters is just the weakness -- the weaker China macro environment. So, is there anything other than an improving China macro environment that could re-accelerate revenue growth?",Min Fan, President and CEO,"Yeah. I think the Chinese GDP growth is slower than the previous years, but China still continues outperforming most of the leading nations in the world. And as one of the major consumption industries -- travel industries in China, we'll continue to deliver robust growth aided by the increase of household incomes and enhanced paid vacation systems. So I think in the near to middle term, still there are some -- probably some macroeconomic issues, but still travel, especially leisure travel, is growing fast in China. And it is expected to become the next growth driver for the travel industry. So I think for Ctrip, we definitely will grab this opportunity to make [even big] success.",8.0,3.0,2.0

I just have housekeeping questions on your balance sheet, I thought that there is a line item of about USD60 million on the short-term borrowing. So, can you clarify what is the purpose of that and if that is in the USD borrowing or the RMB borrowing? And also if you can disclose the operation tax for the quarter.",Jenny Wu, Deputy CFO,"Yeah. Thanks, Alicia. For the short-term borrowing, it's related to the [mechanism] so as to facilitate the share buyback. Firstly, you will also notice that in the -- for restricted cash, this quarter we increased by RMB500 million. It's mainly due to offshore credit facilities secured by [inaudible] by letter of credit as collateral. In Chinese it's called (Chinese language spoken). And this short-term borrowing of RMB300 million and RMB81 million is due to this mechanism to borrowing offshore to support share buyback. The reason for us to do this is because it takes sometime for us to get government [special] approval to [wire] USD300 million out of Mainland China. And that's why we entered into agreement with Merchants Commercial Bank in China that they would lend US dollar to us offshore so that we can buy back stocks. And we need to use about RMB500 million in China as a collateral to secure this loan. So it is merely a balance sheet process.",9.0,1.0,1.0

For the gross margin wise, in this quarter our gross margin for the second quarter is largely flattish around the 75% Q-on-Q. And for the third quarter it will be lower than that level.

First question is actually regarding the hotel promotions you're running in 3Q and its implications for your margin guidance for 3Q. It seems like you're running aggressive for promotion all segments of the hotels -- group buy for five-stars or three-stars hotels. Just wonder, what's the percentage of each of segments are currently under promotion, such promotion? And secondly, given you guided 3Q operating margin at 25% to 27%, what's the assumption for the promotion level? Will the current promotion continue for the rest of the quarter? Or it seems like most of your promotion are due to expire in July.",Jane Sun, COO,"Yes. For the hotels, I think we want to make sure our price remain to be very competitive in the market. So we adjust our strategy based on the market condition. To an extent we see our price has some differentiation in the market, we'll adjust our promotion to make sure in each segment every hotel price remain to be very competitive. Our current 25% to 27% operating margin reflects that strategy, including the intensified e-coupon and also intensified sales and marketing campaign that will allow us to penetrate further into the untouched customer pool.",10.0,1.0,1.0

Second question is actually regarding the air commission rate for second quarter. If I remember correctly, I think at some point in the quarter, management actually communicated you saw some air commission reach -- caught pressure from the airlines, which kind of negatively impact your air growth for the second quarter and I'd say third quarter. It seems like -- I just wonder whether you -- that has happened, and so how -- what's the outlook for 3Q on the air commission rate side -- on air commission rate?",Jenny Wu, Deputy CFO,"Okay. Thank you for the question. First of all, for air ticketing commission rate, they were still ranging in the range of 4% to 5%. And yes, as you mentioned, we -- indeed some downward pressure for our commission rate. In 1Q, air commission rate dropped by 2% to 3% year on year and in late June we see that the commission rate dropped around -- about 5% year on year again. And in 3Q, this time our current visibility, this trend will very likely to continue in July and August. So for the second quarter, we believe that this nominal commission rate will drop by another -- by about 5% year on year again. But for the full year, based on our kind of visibility, this 4% to 5% will still be achievable and it will -- and in the next one to two years, and this will also be the level that -- where it can be sustained. And for the long run, we believe airlines will make [inaudible] on our side, we'll continue to do the best, everything we can control. Especially we will continue trying our best to improve our service quality and efficiency to make to run the business at the lowest of cost but deliver the best services.

4837,38,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","July 25, 2012 9:00 p.m. EDT",Chenyi Lu , Cowen & Co.,"Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the more aggressive sales and marketing campaign that you discussed starting from the late second quarter. Are there any additional products or business lines that you're focusing the additional marketing efforts compared to the first half of this year? And then also related to this, for 50% of the increased sales and marketing expenses that you discussed is related to the e-coupon. Is this effectively the contra-revenue portion or is this the proportion of e-coupons that are actually recognized in the sales and marketing cost line? Thank you.",Jane Sun, COO,"For the product offerings, our belief is a pure sales and marketing is not enough. It has to be coupled with strengthened product offerings and service level. So our goal is three -- we need to achieve three number ones. Product offering needs to be number one, service needs to be the best, and price needs to remain very competitive. So when we have launched this intensified sales and marketing, the product offering needs to be extended as well. So as we discussed, we launched a few new products. Tujia is similar to home-away model. Our [Sungko.com] is targeted at low-end budget customer, similar to hostel world in the world, and we also have [Quixi] which is Smart Hotel Choice that's also similar to a model that's very popular worldwide. So with all the strengthening products coupled with the strengthening sales and marketing, we believe our market share will be extended very effectively. So that's the first thing. And your second question is on the split on the sales and marketing. For e-coupon, if the customer redeem it for our products, then it's a contra-revenue, and two-thirds of the e-coupon is accounted as a contra-revenue. If a customer would like to redeem this e-coupon by exchanging this e-coupon for a gift, for example, a lamp or a luggage, then it's a regular sales and marketing activity. That's about one-third that's capitalized -- captured in the sales and marketing line.",11.0,1.0,1.0

Meanwhile, we kept a balance of the healthy ecosystem. So, largely, I think we monitor the market and make sure our price is maintained at a healthy level, at a very competitive level, but we do not want to do anything that is irrational.",11.0,2.0,1.0

My question is regarding your promotion programs. So I wonder what percentage of your inventory, hotel inventory are you using for this promotion program, e-coupon, cash rebate or any other type of rebate program? And is that only summer or not? If it's not only for summer, how long is it going to last? So that's the second part of the question. The third part of the question, do you see a potential risk that those kind of price war eventually merging to higher-rated hotel area such as four-star hotels or even five-star hotels? That's the first question. And the second is really -- I saw an increase in product development. So I wonder, what are some new products and offerings in the pipeline you're going to put up in the market which could actually help the company to resume the path of growth and as well as maintain the margin [sustainability]?",Jane Sun, COO,"Sure. First of all, on the coverage of the e-coupon, I think we do not set a target, for example, we have a certain percentage of the hotel that needs to be covered by e-coupon. I think we compare our price with the market price and to make sure every hotel that's listed remains to be very competitive in the market. So it's adjusted on a daily basis. But for the high-end customers, they normally do not use the coupon as much as the budget customer. So the three-stars and below hotels, the redemption rate for the e-coupon is higher, and that's the target market we are after to extend our leadership into this are as well. Secondly, in the product line, the increased product investment covers many folds. We have already disclosed a few new products that have been launched, including the Tujia, [Sungko] [secret] hotel offerings. And going forward, there are more hotels -- more products in the pipeline which we'll be rolling out continuously. But we would like to take a very prudent view, because once it's launched, we want to make sure it's a successful launch.

One is the other income, which is primarily the government subsidy, and in 4Q we received quite a lot, but usually the timing and the amount that we can get will depend on the government decision which is beyond our control. And the second part is the non-controlling interest. And recall, we made a lot of investments in recent years, some of them they are still at loss-making stage.

Are we seeing margin stabilization for the time being?",Jane Sun, COO,"Thanks, Richard. Yes, we do see stabilization in margin trend. So for hotel, I think we also monitor the market development very carefully to make sure our pricing stays strong compared to all the other players in the market.",3.0,1.0,1.0
4435,7,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Richard Ji , Morgan Stanley,"Okay, yeah. Thanks. And secondly, your package tour business has been one of the bright spots of -- for your growth. And should we be worried about, you know, your all-out price war into the package tour business? And also, can you give us a little more color on the split between domestic package tour versus overseas portion? Yeah.",Jane Sun, COO,"Sure. The sales for package tour is not going to be materially impact our business because relative to the other business line, package tour still is very small and there are very few players in the market who offer similar products with Ctrip. So the impact is not material. Secondly, domestic versus overseas, in terms of volume it's about 60% overseas. In terms of revenue, it can crawl -- become about 60% to 70% of the total package tour. So overseas definitely grows very fast.",3.0,2.0,1.0
4436,8,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Jiong Shao , Macquarie Securities,"Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I have two as well. The first question is on your guidance. In the past you have given out the segments guidance in terms of the revenues. I was hoping you can do the same for Q1. And also, could you talk about your guidance for the operating margin? I think Jane mentioned stabilization for the operating margins for Q1; I was wondering, do you have a specific range? That's my first question. Thank you.",Jenny Wu, Deputy CFO,"Okay, sure. For the hotel, for 1Q, the volume may grow 25% to 35%. The price, the ADR for hotels may decline 5% year on year, which is mainly due to our further penetration into lower-star hotels and lower-tier cities. For the commission, nominal commission rate, will -- largely flattish. And the e-coupon impact will be around 10% to 15%. So revenue will grow about 10% to 15%. For air ticketing, volume growth will be 15% to 20%. Both the price and the commission rate will largely flattish. The revenue will grow 15% to 20%. For package tours, total revenues may grow 25% to 30%. And for the corporate travel, its growth will be largely in line with air ticketing business which is 15% to 20%. So for Ctrip totally, our top line will grow about 15% to 20%. For the operating margin, as Jane just mentioned, we'll see e-coupon on hotel business stabilize in 4Q. And for 1Q, we expect the similar situation. But 1Q is usually a weaker season, and so we usually see the slight margin decline Q-on-Q. So we will try our best to make sure 1Q's margin will be largely similar to 4Q which is 20% to 21%. That's the visibility we have so far. And I understand the people always want us to give the full year guidance, but actually when we look at the market and look at the competition situation, it's quite dynamic, and our visibility for the rest of the year is limited. So we believe it will be at the investors' best interest if we can guide the more realistic level when we've got clear pictures later on. So going forward we may guide on the [confident] basis. And for Ctrip, people usually know, we are very decisive to invest for our future. On the other hand, we also have very tight cost control, we are very disciplined. We will make sure we'll continue to do that to avoid any -- to avoid losing any pennies. So we will try our best. Thank you.",4.0,1.0,1.0
4437,9,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Jiong Shao , Macquarie Securities,"Okay, great. Thank you, that's extremely helpful. Thank you. And my second question is on the competition side. I think earlier Min mentioned that one of your OTA competitor launched air ticketing coupons a couple of quarters ago, now you are on the offense also. Could you talk about the current competitive dynamic between you and your OTA competitor? And also talk about the e-commerce guys, the vertical search guys and the e-commerce platform, where you think the greatest threat to you may be. Thank you.",Min Fan, President and CEO,"Yeah. I think the competition landscape right now is there's no very big difference from last quarter. And for Ctrip, I think Ctrip is still positioned, very unique positioning in the market. I'd just say Ctrip is the only OTA that has one-stop full service for -- no matter business travelers or leisure travelers. If you compare other OTAs, probably they will just do a product line which we enjoy, and for example, eLong where the main focus is on the hotel side. So I think if you compare OTAs, Ctrip has the most comprehensive product offerings, most sophisticated operating system, and advanced IT infrastructure to service our customers. And also we have our content website and also we have our full suite of mobile apps. So I think for Ctrip, we are really a kind of one-stop solution for any leisure or business travelers, they want to find a one-stop solution, Ctrip is the best place for them to use. And if you're talking about vertical search engine, I should say vertical search engine, normally they will -- just like a platform to just exhibit various kinds of medium to small travel companies and they list their products there. The service experience is not the same and other sales probably not so guaranteed, the quality is not so guaranteed. So I think for customers, if Ctrip can provide the best price as well as other search engines or other OTAs, definitely Ctrip is the best place to shop around.",4.0,2.0,1.0
4438,10,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Mike Olson , Piper Jaffray,"Hey, good morning. I think you said that mobile was 10% of hotel bookings in the quarter. And as China online travel continues to take share from offline, how important is mobile to furthering that transition and how much do you expect mobile will be of hotel bookings for the entire year for 2013?",Min Fan, President and CEO,"Yeah. I think last year we already see our mobile booking volume accounts for more than 10% of our total hotel transaction volume. So for this year I'm sure there will be still very fast and strong growth in this field. Since we have a strong team for mobile app design and interface and also I should say Ctrip wireless app is one of the first travel mobile apps to support LBS services and voice recognition. Our team continuous upgrades the platform and enrich the content to provide very good quality service based on our customer, mobile customers' feedback and booking habits. So definitely we are very confident that Ctrip still will be a far ahead leader in this field in the market.",5.0,1.0,1.0
4439,11,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Mike Olson , Piper Jaffray,"Okay. And then I wanted to ask you about travel metasearch. Travel metasearch is a fast-growing category in the US and Europe, and can you just talk about how you expect travel metasearch to grow or not grow in China and why you think that? And how would growth of travel metasearch sites impact Ctrip?",Jane Sun, COO,"Sure. I think every company has its strengths. Travel metasearch definitely has its convenience for the users, but we believe that in order for a customer to have full services, price searching is one part of the required services. After the search of the price, somebody needs to do a good job to do the fulfillment cycle. And that cycle is very well handled by Ctrip. And if you look at the US market which represents the future for China market as well, travel metasearch, Kayak does a very good job in price searching. But compared to Expedia and also Booking, their sizing and the service they can provide relatively is smaller. And recently I think they also teamed up with Booking. So everyone has its strengths and everyone provides the value to the consumers, but we believe OTA model still is the most comprehensive model for the users. And if you look at the more developed countries, that has been proven to be the model so far.",5.0,2.0,1.0
4440,12,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Ming Zhao , 86 Research,"Thank you. So a follow-up question on the margin. You're talking about flat margin from Q4 to Q1. However, you're going to report a lower top line Q-on-Q. You're also going to apply air ticketing coupon. So, how can you maintain a flattish operating margin? Is it because you're cutting hotel coupon rate further or are you cutting marketing expense? Thank you.",Jane Sun, COO,"For Q1, our margin guidance reflects the impact of the coupon program, and we will do it in a couple of ways. First of all, I think through the coupon program, on the revenue per ticket perspective, it will have a decrease. But we will work very hard to make sure the volume will partially offset that impact. Secondly, internally we will also work very hard to make sure our operation is as effective as possible. So I think for Q1 the guidance has reflected everything we can see so far.",6.0,1.0,1.0
4441,13,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Alex Yao , Deutsche Bank,"Hi. Good morning everyone and thank you very much for taking my question. My first question is on the investment side. In the previous calls, you guys mentioned that investment in 2012 would cause about 4 percentage point margin impact. How would you review the achievements so far from this investment and how do you guide to think about investments in 2013, and what could be the financial impact? Thank you.",Jane Sun, COO,"Investment in the product line and also in technology is ongoing effort. So we will maintain certain level of the investment. In 2012 we have invested in many new products and each line of business has been delivering the results meeting our expectation. So we are very positive in their growth. In 2013, we will still maintain certain level of the investment, and that has been taking into consideration of the guidance Jenny has given to everyone.",7.0,1.0,1.0
4442,14,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Alex Yao , Deutsche Bank,"Got it, thank you. Second question is a follow-up on the air ticket cash rebate. Based on our estimate, your air ticket volume is more than 15 times bigger than the second largest OTA in China. Given such a big difference, from which part, from which channel would you expect it to gain volume from by offering these coupons? Thank you.",Jane Sun, COO,"Yeah. I think air ticketing coupon is one of the strategies we adopt. We believe in order to extend our leadership, every branch needs to stay strong, including our product comprehensiveness, including our IT technology team, including our product and pricing. The coupon give us a leap on the pricing, but we also need to make sure our product is the most comprehensive, which we -- Ctrip does have the advantage in the market because we're the only platform which offers tickets, hotel, package tour, corporate travel and many other services. So if we have a comprehensive solution coupled with the air ticketing coupon, we believe our competitive advantage will be extended.",7.0,2.0,1.0

Thank you.",Jenny Wu, Deputy CFO,"The leisure travel and online travel is growing at a very robust pace and we would consider continue to see this fast growth in 2013, and we also see the continued offline to online migration. So that's one part, and we will see the core market size will continue to expand. And secondly for Ctrip, our market share in the market is still relatively small. We would expect to at least we can proactively embrace the market opportunity and to gain more market share from all fronts.",7.0,2.0,2.0
4444,16,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Aaron Kessler , Raymond James,"Yes, thank you. A couple of questions. First, just to clarify on the air revenue growth, I believe you said 15% to 20%, but then I believe you also said volume growth of roughly 15% to 20%. Can you just clarify? It doesnâ€™t sound like there's impact from the coupon in the guidance for Q1, unless I missed something.",Jenny Wu, Deputy CFO,"Sure. For air ticketing for 1Q, both volume and revenue growth will be around 15% to 20%. And you're right, the air ticketing coupon impact in 1Q will be limited. And as Jane just mentioned, we were methodically to design the whole marketing campaign and to fine-tune our tactics and the coverage and the magnitude according to the market conditions. And for 1Q the impact will be limited. For the rest of the year it will -- we will adjust, fine-tune based on the market situation.",8.0,1.0,1.0
4445,17,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Aaron Kessler , Raymond James,"Okay. And then I have just a follow-up question in terms of the air coupons also. I mean the hotel commission rates are much greater than the air commission rates for you, and so there's probably more of an incentive for consumer to opt for the lower-priced hotels, where they probably wouldn't save much on the air coupon. So just maybe if you can talk about, I mean, is a rebate on the air coupon of just a few dollars, is that enough to really gain further market share on the air whereas hotel may be more compelling?",Jane Sun, COO,"Again I think just having a cash coupon is not enough to compete in the market. Ctrip's competitive advantage has to be in service, pricing, product, IT and branding. All these five items are very important for us. So, coupon is one of the measures that will be taken by us to leap forward in the market.",8.0,2.0,1.0
4446,18,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Aaron Kessler , Raymond James,"Great. And just a final question, can you talk a little bit about the wholesale pricing environment? We were hearing I guess some of the hotels, it sounds like, pulled out of companies that were offering [post-sale] prices on other websites.",Jane Sun, COO,"Yeah. First of all, wholesale price only represents a very small portion of the total volume in the market. So that's very limited. Secondly, if the price is listed online and if it is legal and supported by the hotels, Ctrip as the largest OTA should be able to get it for our customers. And thirdly, if the price is not supported by the hotel or it is not legal, then hotel will discipline all the players in the market to create a very healthy ecosystem. And Ctrip is very much in supportive of hotels' initiatives.",8.0,3.0,1.0
4447,19,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Alicia Yap , Barclays Capital,"Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is actually a follow-up on the air. I know that you said probably 1Q will be more limited. But just wanted to get a sense like, you know, what will be your tactic? For example, are you going to follow your competitor like from route to route matching dollar to dollar like the one that you did on the hotel coupon side? And then for -- the other thing is that will airline, what is the airline views on the OTA doing the discounting? Would that be impacting their direct sales? And how will airline react on that? That's my first question.",Jane Sun, COO,"Sure. For ticket, I think we will study each line very carefully. Some of the routes probably are selling well, it doesnâ€™t take too much effort to sell. Some of the routes might take some effort to promote. And we'll work with the airlines to make sure the sales and marketing campaign we put into these markets will help airlines as well as help our customers to best utilize all the capability in the airline routes. So we'll make sure we work with all the planners to develop our strategy.",9.0,1.0,1.0
4448,20,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Alicia Yap , Barclays Capital,"So, does that mean that airline is actually supporting on you guys doing air couponing?",Jane Sun, COO,We will of course work with all our business partners when we develop our marketing strategy.,9.0,2.0,1.0
4449,21,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Alicia Yap , Barclays Capital,"Okay. And then when you say 1Q is more limited, so does that mean from time to time these things are [accelerating], you probably will increase your magnitude of the discount? Does that mean probably throughout the rest of the year we may see further margin decline if that is the case?",Jane Sun, COO,"So, first of all, our priority is very clear, market grows fast, Ctrip's market share is very small. So in this fast-growing market, our priority is extend our leadership into the market. Secondly, when we do the detailed execution, we'll be very prudent to make sure everything we design will create the best value for our company and for our shareholders.",9.0,3.0,1.0
4450,22,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","January 31, 2013 8:00 p.m. EST",Alicia Yap , Barclays Capital,"I see. And then my second question, very quickly, is on recently there were some comments that you laid off some sales ground employees. So, what exactly happened there? Is that true? And if that's so, are you actually moving more sales and marketing campaigns through online channel with the shift of the online booking that is happening? And is there any plan for you to actually cut down your call center employee as well?",Min Fan, President and CEO,"Okay. I think the expect in the past years were always -- we always study our sales channel, study the efficiency of different kind of sales channel, including marketing channels. Reducing sales presence in some airports is our consistent effort to optimize the return on investment of sales marketing. As we continue to evaluate the efficiency of these marketing channels, we will allocate our resources to more effective ones. So that's why you may know that we later in the next half of last year, we adjust some offline channels in some airports. While we're becoming more dominant in the online business travel segment, our focus right now is to penetrate more into the leisure travel market. So with that, we will allocate more resources to the channels which can generate more effective return such as online channels, such as some efficient marketing channels. So I think it's an ongoing process for us to maximum our return on investment of sales and marketing channels.",9.0,4.0,1.0

And is there any plan for you to actually cut down your call center employee as well?",Jenny Wu, Deputy CFO,And just I'll add. We noticed that there's a lot of false comments in the news about how we handled the layoff and that we care and appreciate our employees very much which [inaudible] being our corporate culture.

So we understand that Ctrip already being number in the business, although I agree that your market share could be a bit small.

First one is actually a quick follow-up on the air couponing program. Just wonder, what's the official timing of launching the program? Secondly, regarding the coupon program, I guess will customer who has coupon or gained coupon through their hotel booking, will that, I guess, will that coupon be applied to your air program or is air coupon program will be very separate from your hotel coupon program?",Jane Sun, COO,"Sure. First of all, timing, I think we're still designing and completing the program, but very much likely to be after the Chinese New Year when the market slows down. Secondly, in terms of the cross-selling, yeah, definitely I think we take into consideration of the comprehensiveness of our product. So we will use all our strengths in different products to make sure the coupon program will generate the best return for our overall revenue, not only air ticket but also hotel, but also package tour.

I do understand we're probably early in the year and there are still a lot of moving parts. But just wonder, compared with your 2012, out of the major lines that have impacted your margin 2012, where we may potentially see some step-up on the cost side or where we may potentially see some leverage or saving? Just some color around that in terms of like marketing direction, that'll be very helpful.",Jane Sun, COO,"I think as we discussed, Q1 margin guidance has taken into consideration everything we can see so far.

Historically you've provided a very detailed quantitative analysis on the hotel coupon's impact on the margin side and how you will recognize those impacts.

Thank you.",Jane Sun, COO,"So in terms of accounting, the treatment will be similar to hotel coupon. In terms of the impact, in terms of dollar amount, again as we discussed before, Q1 number is already included in our guidance.

And on the other hand, in fourth quarter -- in late third quarter we issued a CB, and the underlying shares associated with CB is about 9.3 million. And based on the GAAP requirement, it should be treated as converted basis. So this 9.3 million shares, ADR should be left into the calculation of liability ADRs.

The second question is still really, you know, I tried to get some clarification for air ticketing rebate program, so I really want to understand how that work. I saw a lot of, you know, rebate program attached to your flight information on your website, a lot of them. So, are you saying, even though there are a lot of attached rebate, you're not actually using it in Q1? So if you start to use it, how are you going to -- how it's going to, you know, volume and the revenue still the same growth? I really can't get that math right and I need some help on that front.",Jane Sun, COO,"Sure. As you have seen in the hotel coupon program, when we issued a coupon, volume will have a pick-up. So, volume will increase quite large, which will be partially offset by the decrease on the per hotel commission basis. So the impact on the revenue is a dynamic formula which takes into consideration the increase of the volume and decrease on the per room night income. So we are hoping when we render coupon, we set our priority to take market share. On the other hand, I think we will also carefully design the program so that the revenue gets the best return, our overall revenue portfolio.",13.0,2.0,1.0

So, how could you at the end the volume growth is still in line with your revenue growth in -- not hotel, in the airline front?",Jane Sun, COO,"So again we are still designing our program.

The share-based compensation in the future quarters will be less or unchanged in terms of the total number of -- or I'm sorry, total percentage of revenues? Thank you.",Jane Sun, COO,"Share-based compensation has two elements. One is the number of the shares we grant. The second one is valuation of the shares. The number of the shares is locked every year. So it's a steady number we can control and we control it very tightly. However, the price and also volatility of the stock will impact the valuation of the stock compensation. That number we cannot control.

So, how does it improve the total -- maintain the same level of revenue growth? Thank you.",Jane Sun, COO,"Yeah. I think we designed the program so that overall the revenue growth will be maximized.

So, isn't that affecting the -- either the top line growth as well as the margin because I think the one big advantage is the offline call center is they actually help to upsell the high margin and the high commission product versus the offline, that people can see like anything they would like to, not in the interest of Ctrip?",Jane Sun, COO,"I think if you compare the two platforms, you're right, the call center customer is more high-end, so on a per call basis, probably it generates a little bit higher revenue, which will be offset by a little bit more cost in the labor.

First of all, if it's possible, can you provide us the core organic Ctrip volume growth outlook for both air and hotel for Q1? And the second question is regarding more on the airline ticketing side. So, given the recent dispute between airline and also Qunar, do you see any need for a strategic realignment given the situation recovery is industry-wide for OTA? Further, on the outbound long-haul segment for air ticketing side, what is our plan to take market share given the increasing competition from airline direct sales?

This is Juan calling from 86Research. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions. The first one again is related to your first quarter guidance. Your first quarter guidance, if we compare to the total revenue of Ctrip less Qunar last year, is implying around 37% to 41% year-over-year growth. Over the last year, full year, the gross profit growth was about 50% for each quarter on a consolidated basis. I'm wondering whether the first quarter, that's the bottom for revenue growth for this year and when should we expect a growth acceleration for your revenue? This is the first question. Second question is, with the recent actions airlines have taken against platforms, do you expect the volume contributed by your open platform to your air ticket booking business to decline as a percentage of total? And how would air ticketing commission rate trend going forward? Thank you.",Cindy Wang, CFO,"Sure. So if you look at our long-term growth rate from now to the year 2020, the implied CAGR is around 30%. We believe we are on the right track to achieve our long-term growth rate. And also I think it will be very difficult for us to provide so-called Ctrip alone revenue guidance because Ctrip and our invested companies share some backend inventory systems. And for the question -- as for the question on the air ticket. Ctrip has both the open platform model as well as the agent model.

So, are we expecting the growth to bottom in the first quarter, so, which means we may see a growth acceleration in the later part of the year?",Cindy Wang, CFO,"We do believe this -- because it's still early to provide a full-year guidance at this moment, but we do believe this revenue guidance is -- represents a very healthy and sustainable growth for both Ctrip and Qunar.",8.0,2.0,1.0
47,19,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","March 16, 2016 9:00 p.m. ET",Jialong Shi , Nomura,"Hi, good morning, James, Jane, Cindy and Sue Wei [ph]. Thanks for taking my call. I have two questions. First question is about the air ticketing. We know that Chinese airlines are under pressure to increase their direct sales percentage. So, will that mean the OTA as an industry will lose market share in the air ticketing business going forward? And secondly, for the hotel business, so, after Qunar's acquisition, there are still two very strong competitors in the hotel market, ANI [ph] and Maytuan. So, just wonder how management thinks of the competitive landscape for the online hotel booking industry and what are Ctrip's strategies if any of these competitors resort to irrational couponing or marketing in their bid to grab market share? Thank you.",Jane Sun, Co - President and COO,"Sure. I will address your two questions. First of all, on the airline business, I think both airlines and OTAs will grow very healthily, because the market is growing rapidly and both airlines will benefit from it and the companies that provide good services will benefit from it. I think airlines are also very smart and very market-driven. So they will compare the costs of their direct sales versus the money they are paying to the OTAs. If the direct sales cost is higher than the OTA cost, then naturally, by giving OTA tickets to sell for them, will generate more profit for airlines. So, a rational company will compare, you know, the costs internally versus the costs externally. Whichever channel gives them the best bottom line will be able to benefit the airlines for that. And from OTA perspective, I think we always work very closely with the airlines to support them on the sales channel. Our strength is excellent customer service and strong technology platform. And we will continuously to invest in the technology and also customer service to well-support our partners for airlines to generate the best yields and the best bottom line for them. So that's on the OTA side. And then regarding on the hotel. Yes. I think Ctrip team is always working very hard in the hotel team. Again we have a promise with our customers to give them the best service and best price and best technology to service them. We also have promised with our partners to support them on the backend, to drive the volume for them. In this market, there will be many players as always. There is never a year that, you know, Ctrip is the only player. We always welcome many players in the market. So the other players also provide value in the chain. But again, with Ctrip's investment in the technology and customer services, we believe for the travel market Ctrip will be able to extend our leadership in this market.",9.0,1.0,1.0
48,20,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","March 16, 2016 9:00 p.m. ET",Tian Hou , T.H. Capital,"Good morning, management. I have two questions. The first one is really to your platform model. So your platform model actually generated a lot of traffic and cross-selling result. And in the past, when you design the platform and was actually in the sense of anti-competition, so, right now you have already invested in your competitor in that front. So I wonder, going forward how you're going to deal with this platform business and what's the strategy behind it. That's number one. Number two is for your guidance. So, is that possible to provide some volume growth color in different lines of business, in hotels and your transportation? That's my two questions. Thank you.",Jane Sun, Co - President and COO,"Sure. I think platform model versus self-made tool has its strength and weakness. The platform model give you the wide coverage and also time to market. The self-made tool business give you the strength in customer service. You have more control in these products. So, depending on the customer's need, we're very -- customer is always the king. So, certain customers that focus on reliability and also focus on quality, they naturally will choose to have self-packaged tour as their first choice. And then younger generation, which has a lower income level, price -- they're more price sensitive, then we need to provide them with, you know, price, you know, the products with advantage on it. So as long as you tailor our product offering to these customers and our product display needs to be customized, then we will be able to maximize our strengths and best address different customers at different times. So our technology team spend lots of time to do every testing to make sure they provide the product that is best-suited for our customers' needs. In terms of guidance on volume, I think Cindy provides you with the guidance, and they are mainly driven by volume.",10.0,1.0,1.0

So I just have a couple of questions, small questions on your guidance or outlook. So the first one is I just want to clarify, when you say your Q1 revenue will grow by 75% to 80%, are you comparing to Ctrip or -- in Q1 2015 or Ctrip plus Qunar in Q1 2015?",Cindy Wang, CFO,"Yeah, as we consolidate the Qunar's financials from accounting perspective, from December 31 last year, so from this year we will consolidate Qunar's profit and loss. So the 75% to 80% forecast this year includes Qunar's revenues compared with Ctrip's U.S. GAAP -- Ctrip's revenue under U.S. GAAP last year.",11.0,1.0,1.0

51,23,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","March 16, 2016 9:00 p.m. ET",Ming Xu , UBS,"Okay, got it. Okay. And then the second question is, could you maybe help us understand your current ownership in Qunar? Because I think you announced in early January a deal to further increase your stake in Qunar. So I wonder what's the status now or maybe after the close of this deal, or how much percentage do you expect to own in Qunar?",Cindy Wang, CFO,"Sure. After the transaction with Baidu, Ctrip own approximately 45% voting interest in Qunar. And subsequent to that, Ctrip issued shares and cash to some SPVs and investment entities and affiliates with Ctrip. So therefore, from accounting perspective, Ctrip will start -- started to consolidate Qunar from the end of last year.",11.0,3.0,1.0

54,26,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","March 16, 2016 9:00 p.m. ET",Ming Xu , UBS,"Sure, got it. So the second question is on the transportation. So when you said transportation revenue will grow by 100% to 110%, is that revenue or volume?",Cindy Wang, CFO,"It's the revenue, transportation revenue.",11.0,6.0,1.0
55,27,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","March 16, 2016 9:00 p.m. ET",Ming Xu , UBS,"Revenue. Okay. So, compared to your -- the growth rate in the past few quarters, that accelerates significantly. So I'm just wondering what's the driver behind that.",Cindy Wang, CFO,"Yeah, train ticket contributes a much higher, especially the contribution from the volume, and this is the main reason that you see a very high growth rate for the fourth quarter of last year.",11.0,7.0,1.0
56,28,"Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTRP)","March 16, 2016 9:00 p.m. ET",Ming Xu , UBS,"Yes. So, could you maybe share with us the -- maybe through numbers the ASP or take rate of train ticket and also the revenue contribution of train ticket within your total transportation ticketing business?",Cindy Wang, CFO,"Yes. Still majority, vast majority of the revenue is still contributed from the air ticket business. But for, yes, but for Ctrip, our goal is to provide one stop transportation solutions to our end-users. So it will be more meaningful to combine different product alternatives, including air ticket, train ticket, bus ticket, as well as the car rental services, within one single line item, when we provide guidance or the revenues.",11.0,8.0,1.0

So, one of your competitors that specialize on more outbound trip, a couple of weeks ago, when they reported, I think the guidance for Q1 was significantly lower than the previous growth rate. So I'm just wondering, on Ctrip's, on your perspective, so what's your outlook for Ctrip's outbound travel business for Q1 also for 2016? Do you see a slowdown in demand? Thanks.",Cindy Wang, CFO,"Sure. So in -- this year, still the outbound travel will be a key growth driver for Ctrip across all business lines. For the packaged tour business, outbound travel already accounts for roughly 60% to 70% of our total packaged tour revenue. And we see the growth trajectory is still very well.",11.0,9.0,1.0

I have a question about the distribute of airlines and Qunar. I want to see how much of the sales agency were squeezed out to Ctrip and, on a standalone basis, how much benefit Ctrip will get this share from Qunar. And so far now, like Ctrip is the only provider for -- on Qunar's platform for the Air China and China South Airlines, so, how much market share you can gain from this on a standalone basis, yeah?",James Liang, Chairman and CEO,"Yes. So, well, Qunar is, itself, is -- historically has been operating a different model, so, more of a price competitor and metasearch engine. So it will direct traffic to us. Other OTAs [inaudible] on direct website. So in the past it's been doing that. Of course now there's more traffic directed to Ctrip. We haven't -- we think the situation is still being developed. I think Qunar, they're working with the airlines to [inaudible] they will diversify their traffic destination. So right now I really cannot give a confident [ph] number, but we are operating a different model, so there's some, you know, it's not apple to apple comparison in our volume or our revenue with Qunar.

So [inaudible] the guidance for the segments, seems like that on a consolidated basis, the pack tour is very -- growth is just 40% to 50%. This is -- given this is consolidated of Qunar, seems it is a little bit weak. So, whether this is because -- macro environment or any of the weak 2016, falling exchange rate?",Jane Sun, Co - President and COO,"Qunar's packaged tour is very small. So the number that you are picking up is not significantly influence the growth rate overall. So it's -- the 40% to 50% for us represents a very healthy and promising growth rate going forward. And secondly, our packaged tour business is very rational and very profitable. So we didn't do any irrational spending to artificially boost the volume.

And also I think in the past you provide the rough kind of numbers for the gross margin by different major segments. Given that the elements in those three segments have changed a lot in the past two years, can you maybe update the numbers on the segmental gross margin? And related to that, you mentioned earlier that half of your packaged tour is actually produced in-house and half from suppliers. So what's the gross margin difference between the in-house versus third-party ones for the packaged tour business?",Cindy Wang, CFO,"Sure. So for the GMV, still, transportation reservation service still accounts for majority of our total GMV. For the packaged tour business, it's different from, for example, the group tour business, the open platform already accounts for roughly 40% of our total packaged tour volumes. And for the self-guided tour, still vast majority of the volume contributed from Ctrip's in-house developed products. And in terms of the margins, yes, the open platform, the margin from the open platform could be slightly lower than the self-generated products. But in terms of the operating margin, which including the product development people essentially, the open platform has a higher margin, at least similar level of the operating margin compared with Ctrip's in-house developed products.",13.0,3.0,1.0

On the non-GAAP OP loss margin that you mentioned earlier for the full year, so if I got it correct, is the non-GAAP OP loss, RMB100 million to zero, in 2016, I think Qunar mentioned earlier in the call that they're still targeting the second half breakeven at the OP level. If this is the case, your consolidated full-year non-GAAP OP margin guidance seems to suggest that your organic margin is actually not going to improve versus 2015 level. Can you maybe provide more color on the organic margin expansion for this year implied by your guidance? Thank you.",Cindy Wang, CFO,Sure.
